This collection surpasses my wildest expectations. From the inclusion of the Game Boy games to all three versions of _Tournament Fighters_, Konami, Nickelodeon, and Digital Eclipse have outdone themselves.

Growing up a Gameboy + Genesis kid, I have fond memories of _Fall of The Foot Clan_ and _Hyperstone Heist_, though, I played my fair share of the original TMNT and Arcade games for NES with my step brother and cousins. I was only able to consume crowd favorite _Turtles in Time_ through schoolyard conversations and a handful of quarters at the arcade. And try as I might, Blockbuster always seemed to be out of _Tournament Fighters_. Thanks to the quality-of-life improvements advertised — save anytime, rewind — I can see myself completing all of these titles. I'll be able to conjour up my childhood memories and create some new ones.

Cowabunga, indeed!
