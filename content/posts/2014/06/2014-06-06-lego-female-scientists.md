<blockquote>We’re very excited to release Ellen Kooijman’s Female Minifigure set, featuring 3 scientists, now entitled “Research Institute” as our next LEGO Ideas set. This awesome model is an inspiring set that offers a lot for kids as well as adults.</blockquote>



[From geochemist Ellen Kooijman](http://alatarielatelier.blogspot.se/p/female-minifigure-set.html?zx=7fc735e0789785ac&m=1):



<blockquote>As a female scientist I had noticed two things about the available LEGO sets: a skewed male/female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical representation of the available female figures. It seemed logical that I would suggest a small set of female minifigures in interesting professions to make our LEGO city communities more diverse. </blockquote>



Did I mention that I love LEGO?
