[Neil McFarland, director of games at Ustwo (Monument Valley), as quoted by Gamesindustry.biz](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-06-27-ustwo-monument-valley-left-money-on-the-table-with-premium-price):


<blockquote>Freemium effectively focuses on a niche - they just happen to be whales who spend unlimited amounts of money. Despite freemium games being seemingly for everyone, they're not really.

...

[Premium's] clearly not the best business model, but it was about our passion and the need to communicate something about gaming; a meaningful contribution to the medium, and to not overstay our welcome. Just give people something and that's it - we're not going to press you for endless hours of your time.</blockquote>


I thank the team at Ustwo for a fulfilling and concise experience. Only 90 minutes yet the sights and sounds of Monument Valley still linger in my mind. Relinking my review [here](https://tsogaming.com/2014/04/06/monument-valley-a-review/).

Looking forward to the release of the [Monument Valley original soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/monument-valley-original-soundtrack/id887804425?uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG) by Stafford Bawler, Obfusc & Grigori.
