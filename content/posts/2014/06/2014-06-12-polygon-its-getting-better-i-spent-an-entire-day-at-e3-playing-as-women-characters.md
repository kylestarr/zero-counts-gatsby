[Elisa Melendez writing for Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/12/5803936/women-in-games-e3):


<blockquote>When I look at Ubisoft's recent remarks, I can't even feel anger anymore, just dismay and disappointment. I hoped I could enjoy those same feelings of seeing a version of my gender identity, in co-op, with my husband, a French Lilith and Roland of sorts, overthrowing the monarchy one hidden blade at a time. Knowing just how close they came, and the women they had before them, including in their multiplayer outings, is no salve to the wound. It’s salt.

But, then, I remember Nisha and Athena, Val and Maggie, Fiona, Yvette, and Sasha, and the hunter and speeder. I will still probably play _Assassin's Creed: Unity_, and I will more than likely love it. But maybe not as much as I know I could. That doesn’t take away from the fact I spent an entire day at E3 playing different kinds of video games as women characters, and in some cases women of color.</blockquote>


Great perspective on a side of E3 we unfortunately aren't hearing more about.
