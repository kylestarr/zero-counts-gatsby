<blockquote>And if there’s anything I’ve learned by reading the posts of music listeners online for over a decade: they hate when bands make money. I’m only half kidding here, but I can’t think of any other industry where I’ve seen the consumer of a product be downright caustic if the creator is turning even a marginal profit.</blockquote>
