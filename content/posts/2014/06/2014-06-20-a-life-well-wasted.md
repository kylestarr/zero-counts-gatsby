<blockquote>An internet radio show about videogames and the people who love them.</blockquote>


I am revisiting Robert Ashley's [A Life Well Wasted](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/a-life-well-wasted/id303688916?mt=2&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG). If you're a fan of _Radiolab_, the music of _I Come To Shanghai_Â or Jim Guthrie, and culture and history, you should be listening too.
