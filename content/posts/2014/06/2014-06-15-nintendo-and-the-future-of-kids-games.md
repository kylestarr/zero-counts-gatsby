[Jordan Shapiro, Forbes: E3 From A Father's Perspective](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/06/14/nintendo-and-the-future-of-kids-games-e3-from-a-fathers-perspective/?utm_content=buffer284fa&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer)

A great run down of Nintendo's E3 offerings. It sounds more and more like the Big N stole the show, and without a live press event mind you.
