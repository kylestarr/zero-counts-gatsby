[Nintendo in a statement to Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-06-nintendo-europe-closing-grossostheim-headquarters-130-jobs-lost):


<blockquote>The measures include the consolidation of the current European headquarters in Großostheim (Germany) to Frankfurt (Germany), the closure of the warehouse and office in Großostheim, as well as outsourcing and reorganising some functions.</blockquote>
