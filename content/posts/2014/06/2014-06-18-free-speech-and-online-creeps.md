[Jessica Valenti of The Guardian on Elonis v. United States: whether threats made on social media are protected by free speech.](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/18/free-speech-online-creeps-cyberbullying-laws)


<blockquote>No one is arguing that people can't say hateful things or call people names; the emails I get calling me a "slut" and a "feminazi" are immoral, but they're not (and shouldn't be) illegal. Threats and the invasion of privacy, though, are different â€“ even in the most public of places: your right to be a "creep" doesn't trump everyone else's right to a life free from violence and the fear of it.</blockquote>
