[Laura Naviaux, Sony Online Entertainment's senior VP of global sales and marketing](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-06-03-soe-girl-scholarship-winner-announced):


<blockquote>SOE has prided itself on being a major catalyst of women's involvement in our industry. As our company continues to evolve and diversify our portfolio, we've found it imperative to refine our approach with game art and development, seeking out varied perspectives from the current and future leading voices in the industry. The market for compelling and original online game experiences is rapidly evolving and as a publisher it is our responsibility to listen and celebrate the spectrum of play styles among our global community, and deliver innovation in art, design and technology.</blockquote>
