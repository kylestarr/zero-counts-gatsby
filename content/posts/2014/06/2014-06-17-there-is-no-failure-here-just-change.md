[Russ Pitts](http://www.falsegravity.com/?p=956):


<blockquote>There will be those cynical few who consider my departure an admission of some kind of failure that they, watching from the sidelines, predicted long ago. They will say, “I told you so.” And that’s OK. They’re right. They did tell us so. But that was the easy part.

Throwing rocks from the gallery at those who are trying to do something ambitious is no great accomplishment. I’d rather be the one who rolls up his sleeves and tries to accomplish something inspiring, even if it may fail. Even if it won’t last.

But there is no failure here, just change. I’ll never be ashamed of the ambitious dreams we built at Polygon, and I’ll never be afraid to try again. Hopefully my modest successes will inspire others to do their own great, ambitious things and build their own dreams.</blockquote>


There is a sinking feeling in my gut. No sooner had I posted [this](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/17/personality/), I learn of Russ Pitts' departure from Polygon. For those unfamiliar with Pitts, his work on [Operation Supply Drop](http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/16/5179074/launching-operation-supply-drop) and [GlassLab](http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/4/24/5636832/glasslab) are nothing short of earth-shattering. There is only a bright future for such a talented writer. Godspeed.
