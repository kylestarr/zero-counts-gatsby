<blockquote>We found support for the hypothesis that, in general, women would gain more compliance with friend requests than men. We also found support for the hypothesis that women making positive utterances would gain more compliance with friend requests than women making negative utterances, whereas men making negative utterances would gain more compliance with friend requests than men making positive utterances.</blockquote>


This sounds in-line with [Rosalind Wiseman and Ashly Burch's findings](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020370/The-Connection-Between-Boys-Social).
