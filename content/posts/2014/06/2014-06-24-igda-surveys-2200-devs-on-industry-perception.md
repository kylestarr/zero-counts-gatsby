[Tracey Lien, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/24/5835822/survey-poor-work-conditions-and-sexism-give-games-industry-a-bad-rap):


<blockquote>When it came to the factors influencing society's negative view of games and the people who make them, 68 percent of respondents said reports of the industry's working conditions were a contributing factor. Sexism in games followed closely at 67 percent. 62 percent of respondents named the perceived link to violence as a factor. 51 percent said sexism in the workforce was a problem, while 49 percent attributed the negative perception to the perceived link to obesity. 42 percent of respondents blamed the lack of overall diversity in the industry.</blockquote>
