> A platform that changes the input to a simulation or video game based on the user's physiological state.

Alan Pope, NASA Scientist, as quoted by Fast Company:

> In terms of applications, we’re looking for places where this can be deployed as a form of entertainment and also training. There are a number of situations where someone could be trained using a video game-like task. It could be sharpshooters in the military, surgeons who would need to control their attention and anxiety--any kind of task that puts pressure on someone while they’re performing the task with their hands or manually.

While I struggle with my internal "simulation" v. "video game" terminology debate, I thought I'd share this neat interactive mechanic.
