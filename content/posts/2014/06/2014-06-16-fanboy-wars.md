Forbes writer Paul Tassi's _[Fanboy Wars](http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/fanboy-wars-the-fight-for-the-future-of-video-games/)_ focuses on the fifteen-year span between the early 2000s and today's gaming empire and the intense impact "fanboys" have had. It details the beginning of the Sony and Microsoft living room war to Facebook's $2 billion Oculus acquisition. This quick 70-odd page read acts as a great refresher for those with interest in the space and a primer for those looking to familiarize themselves with the modern industry while trimming the fat of history.

Following the likes of Jane McGonigal, Tassi needs face-time to preach the power behind fanboyism. His ideas are a realization that today there exists a single community manifesting great power in an unlikely place; a community that can course correct multi-billion dollar companies yet heartless enough to lay waste to its own kind. While only the tip of the iceberg, I fear that the book will only fall on a choir of gaming peace-keepers and business types rolling their eyes at the idealism found in the pages.

My one large critique of _Fanboy Wars_ is Tassi's neglect to mention the seemingly poisoned and downtrodden heart of the industry: Developers. While he spend much time lamenting over harsh criticism developers receive from fanboys, he skips over the harsh reality developers face in [studio turnover](http://tsogaming.com/2014/03/13/save-developers-and-you-will-save-your-soul/). His miss at the potential upside of Xbox One's DRM for industry devs leaves his argument a bit unbalanced. Whether or not Microsoft's original DRM strategy would have been a boon against the industry's continuous and tragic staff up/layoff pattern remains to be seen, but even a brief adage about the potential benefits to a new console experience would have been refreshing. Hopefully this insight will be saved for Tassi's next piece.

All told, Tassi mustered up a quick, easy-to-digest summary of today's gaming world. While his grander message is a realization of the incredible power in oft-scorned fanboyism, _Fanboy Wars_ doesn't offer much depth for those already harboring intense focus on the industry; however, the book works as a great catch-up for new comers to the industry. Here's to hoping that _Fanboy Wars_ is a prelude to a something greater.
