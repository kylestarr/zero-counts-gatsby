[Keith Stuart, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/09/e3-2014-microsoft-press-conference-the-key-points):


<blockquote>Broadcast live over the internet to millions of viewers the world over, the message couldn't be more clear: last year's emphasis on the strength of the Xbox One as a multimedia and live TV platform was a mistake. This is a games machine that also does other stuff that no one here really wants to hear about.

At the end of a pummeling 90 minutes of game announcements and confirmations, Spencer took to the stage again and said, "thank you for making your voice heard, thank you for helping us shape the future of the new Xbox." Basically, it's what Microsoft has been saying for the last six months â€“ we listened, we changed, now eat this.</blockquote>


The 2014 Microsoft sounded a lot like the 2013 Sony. I would have loved for Microsoft to double-down on their original DRM and Kinect strategy, offering up an entertainment ecosystem that could have set Xbox One outside of the HD Twins comparison. Alas, their indie games showcase offered up impressive tiny titles that could end up system sellers, and that says a lot.
