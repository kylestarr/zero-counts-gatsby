[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/25/sony-playstation-tv):


<blockquote>The most surprising (to me) part of Google’s Android TV announcement today was that Sony would be integrating it into their 2015 TV sets. Why in the world would Sony agree to integrate what is obviously a direct competitor to Playstation TV in its own TV sets?</blockquote>


Subsidization? Lack of confidence? A Google play for PlayStation cross-branding? Vice versa?

I don't think Sony is terribly worried about Android's role in gaming, especially against Sony's library of PlayStation back-catalog (though, [maybe it should be](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/26/5845180/unreal-engine-4-android-demo-video)). At the same time, incorporating other Google services (media and otherwise) will likely serve as a marketing boon for Sony. Nonetheless, it is an odd move.
