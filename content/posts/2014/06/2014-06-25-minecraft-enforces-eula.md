[Keith Stuart, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/minecraft-how-a-change-to-the-rules-is-tearing-the-community-apart):



<blockquote>The grievance many Minecraft fans had was simple: although these terms had always been present in Mojang's Minecraft EULA, they had never been enforced over the three years since the game's launch. Mojang had always fostered a laissez faire sensibility; it had pushed Minecraft as an open platform, freely customisable by both players and server providers. But now it was tightening the leash. And people were angry.</blockquote>


Never say never. Mojang is in the right. If you are going to build a business under a given set of rules, comply and seek community-fueled change with the first-party for the future. While many will ask for Mojang to target the bad apples, the scale of a piecemeal crackdown would be nigh impossible to complete given the global nature of the greater Minecraft server spread. Their EULA was built with this in mind.
