[Reggie Fils-Aime, President of Nintendo America, as quoted by Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/11/5801862/mario-kart-8-wii-u-sales):


<blockquote>It's one of the things I have to do with certain media, remind them, look, for us, the drive toward the holiday began a couple of weeks ago with Mario Kart 8, and that's off to a fantastic start. For us, on a global basis, and certainly here in the United States, it's driving hardware, which is great to see.</blockquote>



Sounds like I was on [the right track](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/01/hail-mary-o/).
