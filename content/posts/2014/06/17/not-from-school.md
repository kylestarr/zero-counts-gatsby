[Lorne Lanning, creator of Oddworld in an interview with Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/17/5816546/oddword-lorne-lanning-new-n-tasty-e3-sony-playstation):

> I'm a kid who learned how to read from Sesame Street, not from school, so I believe in the power of media to make a better world.

I had an eerily similar thought this morning. I'm a kid who learned how to type from AIM, not from school, so I believe in the power of [experiential learning](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning) to make a better world. This is something I believe to be at the heart of video games.
