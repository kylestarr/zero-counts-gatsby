[Sarah Jeong of The Guardian on the anonymous nature if Uber](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/20/technology-disrupt-racism-sexism-silicon-valley): 


<blockquote>It's doubtful that Uber specifically set out to improve the lives of African-Americans. But the company accidentally did something that anti-discrimination statutes and awareness-raising campaigns were unlikely to ever achieve. It's not exactly a huge blow to racism, but still: technology is changing how people of color experience and are represented in the world, and it's all the more remarkable that much of this was never intended in the first place.</blockquote>


A very interesting read on technology's  inadvertent effects on racial and gender discrimination.
