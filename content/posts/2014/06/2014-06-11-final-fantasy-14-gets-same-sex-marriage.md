[Naoki Yoshida, Director and Producer of Final Fantasy 14, as quoted by Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/ps4/2014/6/11/5800432/final-fantasy-14-same-sex-marriage-mmo-pc-ps4):


<blockquote>People within Eorzea will be able to pledge their eternal love and or friendship in a ceremony of eternal bonding. And this will be open to people regardless of race, creed, and gender. Two players...if they want to be together, in Eorzea, they can-through this eternal bonding ceremony.

We discussed it and we realized: within Eorzea, why should there be restrictions on who pledges their love or friendship to each other? And so we decided to go this way.</blockquote>
