Nintendo did not apologize or ignore; they listened. Playful jabs at current conversations (eerily close to the last [IGN NVC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nintendo-voice-chat-e3-2014/id276268457?i=314175045&mt=2&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG)) and admittance of shortcomings was a nice touch to the digital event. That said, the 46-minute presentation left something to be desired. A blowout of late 2014 Smash Bros. content will not be enough to whet the appetites of naysayers.

Nintendo is wise to focus and build out the Mushroom Kingdom with _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_, more Yoshi, and Amiibo. Even wiser to remind audiences where their gaming experiences started.
