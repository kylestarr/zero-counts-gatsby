[Tracey Lien on Polygon's Friends List podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/is-we-dont-have-resources/id718996373?i=314646483&mt=2&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG):


<blockquote>If all the games you're playing exclude women and all the media you're consuming excludes women, that's going to chip away at your mind in some way. It's going to shape your worldview in someway. I think that is potentially damaging to kids growing up playing these games but also to women who are playing them and feeling excluded. There's really no reason for it.</blockquote>


In light of the recent [Assassin's Creed news](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/11/no-females-in-assassins-creed-unity-co-op/), this short discussion between Lien and colleague Megan Farokhmanesh hammers at every nail in the Women in Games conversation. Lien is the writer of the [No girls allowed](http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed), a must-read look back on early video game marketing and the creation of the "boys club" vacuum.
