[Vanessa Thorpe, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/07/bjork-environmental-campaign-timetable-nordic-schools):


<blockquote>[Björk's] initiative, funded by the Nordic Council, is designed to be non-academic and has already been used in an informal way in Iceland. In an interview with the Observer magazine to be published next week , she said the programme had been "really popular with kids who have ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] or dyslexia" because it gets away from the classroom-bound, traditional nature of the Icelandic curriculum. "Unfortunately, it means we have to sit down and write a curriculum, and that's a contradiction."</blockquote>


[Biophilia](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bjork-biophilia/id434122935?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG) was such a brave and ambitious project ( I expect nothing less of Björk). Stellar news.
