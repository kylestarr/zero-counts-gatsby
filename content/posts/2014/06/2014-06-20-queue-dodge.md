[Riot Games](http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20140619/1304/announcing-queue-dodge):


<blockquote>From the beginning, we’ve focused on culture. We operate on a foundation of shared mission, values, passion, trust, and mutual respect. If someone gags on the unique flavor of our culture, they’d be doing themselves and the company a disservice to hang on just for the paycheck. Culturally aligned people and teams are more effective, and alignment around mission and values allows us to better serve players. We’ve designed Queue Dodge to help self-identified mismatches move on in an open, positive, and constructive way. </blockquote>


Quit with 10% salary up to $25,000 within 60 days of employment. Interesting; however, most find it takes 6-8 months to feel at home. I wonder if a decision at a yearly evaluation would be better or too late; too much invested by both ends to severe ties.
