[Matthew DiPietro, VP of Marketing & Communications at Twitch](http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/06/gamers-are-awesome-and-we-can-prove-it/):


<blockquote>Since the Twitch community has been in an ever-increasing spotlight for the last few years, more and more people have been trying to wrap their heads around the Twitch phenomenon. They ask: “Why in the world would anyone want to watch other people play video games?” That’s still a very common question, believe it or not.</blockquote>



[Miranda Sanchez at IGN sums the data:](http://ign.com/articles/2014/06/05/gamers-have-more-social-lives-than-non-gamers)


<blockquote>According to the study, gamers are more social than non-gamers and have better connections with their families. The report said that 72% of gamers play games with their friends, and found that "spending time with their families (82% vs. 68%) and parents (67% vs. 44%) are top priories."

Additionally, the study said gamers are more likely to have a college degree (43% vs. 36%), are more optimistic about their career goals (67% vs. 42%), and are more likely to have a career they want to be in (45% vs. 37%).

The study also addressed the demographics of gamers; 52% of gamers are male, 48% are female, and as much as 73% of Millennials, 62% of Generation X, and 41% of Baby Boomers are playing video games.</blockquote>
