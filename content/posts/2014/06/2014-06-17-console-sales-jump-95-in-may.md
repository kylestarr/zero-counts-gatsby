[Luke Karmali, IGN](http://ign.com/articles/2014/06/17/ps4-is-best-selling-console-for-five-months-straight-in-us):


<blockquote>The NPD Group's video game sales report for the month reveals that console sales jumped up a massive 95 percent year-on-year to $586 million, with console software sales also climbing 57 percent to $274 million.

Titles singled out for praise on the games front include Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8, with the latter being largely responsible for Wii U sales jumping up 85 percent despite only being on sale for two days of the month. Despite this, the Wii U was edged out by Nintendo's 3DS handheld, which took second place behind Sony's PS4 in terms of the best-selling hardware of the month.</blockquote>


Software sells hardware. This is impressive for all systems considering the spike occurred before E3. I'm really looking forward to June's figures. My money is on Wii U. [Hail Mario](https://tsogaming.com/2014/06/01/hail-mary-o/).
