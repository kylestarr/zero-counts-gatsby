[Phil Harrison, Microsoft Studios Europe, in an interview with Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-19-microsoft-pledges-to-support-rare):


<blockquote>We are very fortunate in having Rare and Lionhead in the UK as crown jewels of Microsoft Studios.

Rare is working on a couple of things at the moment, which we will announce at the right time. But I'm really excited by the things they're doing and I believe you will be as well when you hear about them.</blockquote>


At E3 2014, [Nintendo won over](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/15/nintendo-and-the-future-of-kids-games/) the hearts and respect of longtime fans by investing in first-party favorites, doubling-down on the Mushroom Kingdom, and acknowledging classic IP. Microsoft is not blind to the effectiveness ofÂ this move.

_Killer Instinct_ was rebooted last year and Conker is making his way into _Project Spark_. My suspicions still lie [here](http://tsogaming.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-swinging-for-the-franchise-fences-with-rare-ip/).
