[Jordan Shapiro, Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/06/26/the-hidden-moral-messages-in-video-games/?ss=power-productivity/):


<blockquote>By themselves, gameplay actions seem fairly meaningless. For example, most first person shooters are essentially just complex three dimensional virtual simulations of the carnival classic: whack-a-mole. We’ve seen it with many different skins and themes: military, zombie, duck hunting, dinosaurs. Something pops up and the player needs to react quickly–strike a moving target before you miss your chance.</blockquote>


Well put. Great piece.
