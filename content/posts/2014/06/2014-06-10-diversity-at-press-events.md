[Danielle Riendeau, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/10/5797132/e3-2014-women-at-e3-violence-e3-2014):


<blockquote>It wouldn't hurt the publishers to pay more mind to diversity when choosing people to speak at press events. And it would certainly help make E3 a slightly more welcoming place for the rest of the 75 percent or so of people that make up the population. White men are a minority in the world, and video games have an international audience.</blockquote>


My E3 2014 [Genre/Gender Breakdown](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2013/06/15/e3-2013/) data is still in the works but this makes me think I should include ethnicity as well. View myÂ current data [here](https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAISmZ95pCgA8Yiebf-BLfFUOwWdZncAG3uF/e3_2014_gameslist).
