[Andrew Webster delivers Temple Run and Temple Run 2 joint analytics](http://theverge.com/2014/6/4/5776232/temple-run-1-billion-downloads):


<blockquote>Alongside the milestone, Imangi also revealed a number of details about its audience, which helps to illustrate the changing landscape of mobile games. 60 percent of all players are female, for instance, and the game is most popular in China, which accounts for 36 percent of all downloads. The next largest market is the US at 21 percent.</blockquote>
