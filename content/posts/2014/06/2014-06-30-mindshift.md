[Fast Company](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3032327/new-video-games-based-on-nasa-tech-change-gameplay-based-on-how-stressed-you-are):


<blockquote>A platform that changes the input to a simulation or video game based on the user's physiological state.</blockquote>


Alan Pope, NASA Scientist, as quoted by Fast Company:


<blockquote>In terms of applications, we’re looking for places where this can be deployed as a form of entertainment and also training. There are a number of situations where someone could be trained using a video game-like task. It could be sharpshooters in the military, surgeons who would need to control their attention and anxiety--any kind of task that puts pressure on someone while they’re performing the task with their hands or manually.</blockquote>


While I struggle with my internal "simulation" v. "video game" terminology debate, I thought I'd share this neat interactive mechanic.
