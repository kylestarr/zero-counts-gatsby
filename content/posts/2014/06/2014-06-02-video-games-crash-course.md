[Keith Stuart, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/02/parents-guide-video-games-playstation-xbox-wii-apps-children?CMP=ema_565):


<blockquote>For people who don't play video games, they can seem like a strange and vaguely threatening interloper into the household.

These noisy yet seemingly seductive things are on computers, on smartphones and tablets, and on expensive consoles that your kids will tell you everyone else has. And if you're not buying them for your children, your children are probably playing them elsewhere.

Even if you never intend to play a game in your life, you should probably know about them – if only to understand what it is that drags other people in.</blockquote>


Stuart continues to churn out great work over at The Guardian. As stated, this piece is a must for parents and (honestly) everyone else. The piece highlights everything from free-to-play to the state of major developers, financials to education; plus some [Hearthstone](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/humanity-in-hearthstone/), [Monument Valley](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/monument-valley-a-review/), and [Mario Kart 8](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/hail-mary-o/) love. Good to the last sentence.
