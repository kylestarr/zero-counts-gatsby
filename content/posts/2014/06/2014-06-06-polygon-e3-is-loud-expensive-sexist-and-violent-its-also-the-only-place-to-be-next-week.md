[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5782670/e3-Sony-microsoft-nintendo-news-planning):


<blockquote>The features you enjoy, the in-depth interviews you want to read, and the informed work that comes from your favorite sites will often start at a conversation at a bar during an event like E3. Every conversation at E3 is an opportunity to find and share information about the industry and games we all love, and that's why we go. The giant video screens are a distraction from the real work, not a part of it.</blockquote>
