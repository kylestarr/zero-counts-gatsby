[Author Blake J. Harris on his new book, Console Wars, as quoted by Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/7/5778038/console-wars-interview-blake-harris):


<blockquote>My biggest influences on business writing are Ben Mezrich and and Michael Lewis. But the actual greatest influence on the narrative style has to be Game of Thrones. Because, really, that's what this story is. It's all these different families or corporations and entities competing for this one seat at the top of the table that they all think they deserve for a variety of different reasons. Or that they believe that they should inherit â€” because it's their God-given right or because they have the right strategy, and they deserve it.</blockquote>



I've been extremely excited for this read. I might have to shelve [Catmull](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/creativity-inc./id733503589?mt=11&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG) and [Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG) in lieu of [Console Wars](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/console-wars/id718597648?mt=11&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG), or Game of Games.
