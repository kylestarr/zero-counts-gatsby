[Tracey Lien, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/13/5805472/mario-maker-started-out-as-a-tool-for-nintendos-developers):


<blockquote>[Takashi] Tezuka told Polygon the people on the tools team typically don't design video game courses â€” they only build the tools for Nintendo's game designers to use. In this particular instance, the tools team was working on a Mario course editing tool when they decided to pitch it to Tezuka as a standalone game.</blockquote>



The Wii U GamePad + TV is effectively a gigantic Nintendo DS. Nintendo found success in the interactive second screen experience of the DS. _Mario Maker_ seems like a great way to push the GamePad. Rather than pushing a passive off-screen experience, taking a note from the DS is a fantastic idea. 

Aside from unboxing my Wii U, I had completely glossed over the GamePad stylus.
