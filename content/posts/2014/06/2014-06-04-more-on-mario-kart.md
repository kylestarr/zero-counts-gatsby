[Nintendo press release](http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=41679):



<blockquote>Nintendo reported today that the game sold more than 1.2 million total units across Japan, Europe and the Americas during its first weekend on the market.</blockquote>



Excluding Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart Advance remains the weakest entry in the series at 5.91 million units. There is work to be done.
