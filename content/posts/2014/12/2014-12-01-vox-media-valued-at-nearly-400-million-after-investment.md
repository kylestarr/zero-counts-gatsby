[The New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/media/vox-media-valued-at-nearly-400-million-after-investment.html):


<blockquote>Anton Levy, head of General Atlantic’s Internet and technology team, said his firm — like other investors — had typically avoided content creators like Vox in favor of platforms with many capabilities like Facebook and Alibaba. Lately, he said, the firm has had a change of heart.

“We think we are at an inflection point,” he said. “For the next five years, you are going to have the next generation of media platforms emerge. There are parallels to cable in the ’80s. There is going to be a huge amount of value creation.”

The chief executive of Vox Media, Jim Bankoff, has made no secret of his ambition to build his company into a kind of Time Inc. of the 21st century; that is, a multipublication giant with reach into young, affluent homes across the country on topics as diverse as sports and real estate.</blockquote>


The moment I laid eyes on Polygon, I was taken aback by its noisy design, overblown articles, nondescript headlines...

And then it scrolled forever. And ads were limited or nicely designed. And its design reacted to my device in real-time. And the features featured unique layouts. And the video production was on another level. And the "nondescript" headlines were enticing. And the "overblown" articles were full of fantastic journalism and entertaining personality. And the "noisy" design was unlike anything I had ever seen.

I latched on to Polygon's community and began posting lengthy, passion fueled comments. I realized that these were not comments, they were blog posts. I used those "comments" as the foundation for a new WordPress blog titled _The State of Gaming_, which I later renamed _Zero Counts_.

From [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com) to [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com) to [Vox.com](http://www.vox.com), Vox Media has changed the way I consume content. Every article includes something of interest. Every layout choice is surprising and exciting. Their dedication to personality, engineering, and design is second-to-none. Congratulations, Vox Media. I saw this coming from a coast away.

**UPDATE**: Polygon editor-in-chief Chris Grant has sent out the following tweet:


<blockquote>Nov was [@Polygon](https://twitter.com/Polygon)'s best month yet, w/ 10.5m uniques. That's 140% over last Nov, which had 2 new consoles! Thx so much for reading, everyone!

It's so great to read about this success. Great job, Polygon Team.
