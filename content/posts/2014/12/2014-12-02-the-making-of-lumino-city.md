Brave. Daring. Ambitious. Inspired. Inspiring. Beautiful.

Not twenty minutes before watching this video was I listening to Howard Shore's _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ soundtrack, ruminating on what it must have felt like to be involved in such a massive, all-consuming project as _The Lord of the Rings_ film franchise. I often fantasize about working as a builder or set designer on those projects, bringing Tolkien's Middle-earth to life. Imagining the construction of _Lumino City_ brings about the same thoughts and is far more compelling than the game itself, and boy what an amazing game it looks to be.

State of Play's _Lumino City_ will be available tomorrow, December 3rd, via [Steam for Mac and PC](http://store.steampowered.com/app/205020/). Official trailer below.
