[Charles Yu, writing for The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/novelist-charles-yu-on-st-george-california-reserve-agricole-rum-1419610923):



<blockquote>It’s at this point, while having my second dialogue with St. George, that I come to a formulation of a new worldview. If writing about music is like dancing about architecture, then writing about alcohol is like dancing about alcohol, especially if you write about it while drinking it. Or something like that; I don’t know. I think my analogy went fuzzy halfway through. That’s the thing about rum criticism. It is the most honest art form, in that it allows you to demonstrate the effects of the product directly on the comprehensibility of your prose. Case in point: the previous sentence. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some rum to eat.</blockquote>


Fun read. Sounds great.
