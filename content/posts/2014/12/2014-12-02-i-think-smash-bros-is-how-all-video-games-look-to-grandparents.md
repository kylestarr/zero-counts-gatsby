Polygon video producer Griffin McElroy showcasing the new features of _Super Smash Bros. Wii U_ to Polygon managing editor Justin McElroy on _Polygon's Overview_, time stamp [14:06](http://youtu.be/q8a3yEWMYlA?t=14m6s):


<blockquote>JM: Griffin... do you ever look at Smash Bros., when you're me, and think, "I bet this is how all video games look to my nani?"

GM: Ya, I think so. Ya, probably. Are you saying that because it's just like really crazy and hectic and inscrutable? Or because it's like, "Ahh! You gotta use the Pac-Man to eat the Marios!"

JM: Like both, I guess. I think Smash Bros. is how all video games look to grandparents.

GM: Probably. Maybe.</blockquote>


It's not just grandparents:


<blockquote>Watching the [Super Smash Bros. Wii U 50-Fact Extravaganza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0BBGzfw0pQ). My brain stopped comprehending at no 9. What the hell happened to video games?

I've put in a few hours and I'm still not sure I know what I'm doing.
