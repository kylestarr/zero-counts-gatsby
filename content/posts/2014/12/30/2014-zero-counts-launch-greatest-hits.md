In April 2014, I realized my blog _[TheStarrList](https://thestarrlist.wordpress.com)_ had taken a hard turn into gaming. It was time to start something new. I gathered up those gaming-centric posts from _TheStarrList_ along with several lengthy comments I had made on _Polygon_ and _IGN_ articles and stuffed them into a blog formatted after John Gruber's [_Daring Fireball_](http://daringfireball.net). In May 2014, I launched _The State of Gaming_ with the intention to focus on business, controversy, culture, education, history, health, and other topics in the gaming industry. After a link on _Daring Fireball_, I decided to cool-down the blog's pretentious title into something more personal. I recalled a childhood debate: When considering "lives" in video games, does "x1" mean you are on your last, or does zero count?

Writing about games has long been a dream of mine, but there has always been insecurity in indulging in entertainment critique and commentary. For lack of better terms,_ Zero Counts_ has tapped into a rich well of inspiration, passion, and creativity. By surrendering my inhibitions about games writing, I have written more frequently and published more on varied topics than ever before.

Without further adéu, here are the most popular posts from launch year, 2014:
