In April 2014, I realized my blog *[TheStarrList](https://thestarrlist.wordpress.com)* had taken a hard turn into gaming. It was time to start something new. I gathered up those gaming-centric posts from _TheStarrList_ along with several lengthy comments I had made on _Polygon_ and _IGN_ articles and stuffed them into a blog formatted after John Gruber's [_Daring Fireball_](http://daringfireball.net). In May 2014, I launched *The State of Gaming* with the intention to focus on business, controversy, culture, education, history, health, and other topics in the gaming industry. After a link on _Daring Fireball_, I decided to cool-down the blog's pretentious title into something more personal. I recalled a childhood debate: When considering "lives" in video games, does "x1" mean you are on your last, or does zero count?

Writing about games has long been a dream of mine, but there has always been insecurity in indulging in entertainment critique and commentary. For lack of better terms, *Zero Counts* has tapped into a rich well of inspiration, passion, and creativity. By surrendering my inhibitions about games writing, I have written more frequently and published more on varied topics than ever before.

Without further adéu, here are the most popular posts from launch year, 2014:

1. [Hail Mario](/2014/06/01/hail-mario/) (linked by [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/hail-mario))
2. [Humanity in Hearthstone](/2014/04/17/humanity-in-hearthstone/)
3. [Club Nintendo stuck in Mario Kart traffic](/2014/05/31/club-nintendo-stuck-in-mario-kart-traffic/)
4. [Old School Hip Hop is the new Golden Oldies](/2014/12/28/old-school-hip-hop-is-the-new-golden-oldies/) ([retweeted by Ben Thompson](https://twitter.com/monkbent/status/549556088509452288))
5. [Save developers and you will save your soul](/2014/03/13/save-developers-and-you-will-save-your-soul/)

Looking forward to even more writing in 2015.
