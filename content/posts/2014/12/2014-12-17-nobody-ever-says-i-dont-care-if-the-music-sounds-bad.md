[John Gruber, The Talk Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ep.-103-robotitize-assembly/id528458508?i=327554335&mt=2):


<blockquote>In general, I would rather read an interesting, well-written novel that's poorlyÂ typeset than read a terrible novel that is beautifully typeset. Of course. That's the difference. Even me as somebody obsessed with typography would agree with that. Whereas with music, nobody ever says "I don't care if the music sounds bad," like at a technical level. It's fundamental to listening to music. But as the person making the device, that should be the obsession.</blockquote>
