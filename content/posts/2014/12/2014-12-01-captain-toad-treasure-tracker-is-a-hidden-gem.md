[Andrew Webster, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/1/7303799/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review):


<blockquote>Whatever fate awaits the Wii U, Nintendo is doing just about everything it can to make sure the console has some amazing games. It may not have third-party support, but [Nintendo's own releases feel exciting](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5805024/nintendo-is-exciting-again-e3-2014) in a way they haven't for years. At a glance, Captain Toad seems like a throwaway game, a weird little spinoff starring a character no one really cares about. Yet it's one of the best puzzle games of the year, and another one of a growing number of reasons to pick up a Wii U.</blockquote>



The Verge calls _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ "a hidden gem"; [I called it "genius"](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/11/captain-toad-is-genius/). Needless to say, I cannot wait for December 5th.
