[Myke Hurley of Relay FM interviewing Neil McFarland, Director of Games at ustwo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/monument-valley-meet-developer/id947965068?mt=2):


<blockquote>MH: Visually, Monument Valley's levels, they focus a lot on optical illusions and trickery. How much more difficult is that to develop for than just creating a straight "go from here to here" type level?

NM: It offers a lot of different challenges. We're trying to delight people. There is that moment of delight when you turn the Penrose triangle around, you see it for the first time. Something goes from 2D to 3D and you suddenly see a connection that's not there. It's magic. For us, it was a drive to see how many of those we could uncover and re-engineering things and playing and trying and failing and getting it right and getting it wrong. It's not easy but we were following our noses and following intuition and just seeing how many of those moments we could find within the concept.</blockquote>


The software engineering behind video games is still beyond me. Even so, I couldn't help but wonder just how ustwo were able to engineer _Monument Valley's_ impossible yet traversable objects on the fly. Magic is right.
