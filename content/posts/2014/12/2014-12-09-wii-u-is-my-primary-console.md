[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/9/7360131/wii-u-nintendo-game-of-the-year):


<blockquote>That reality is rather quickly washed away by the fact that the Wii U has built the best library of exclusives of the current consoles, and that's another trend that won't likely end anytime soon. It would be hard to turn the Wii U into your primary console — there are simply too many games that will never be on the platform — but it's equally hard to ignore Nintendo's latest piece of hardware. There are simply too many amazing games that _won't_ be available on any other console.

This situation replicates what happened in the last generation: The argument between the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is ongoing and contentious, but you don't _really_ need both. If you want to make sure you hit as many software high points as possible, you need a PlayStation 4 _or_ Xbox One _and_ a Wii U. The same way you needed a PlayStation 3 _or _Xbox 360 _and_ a Wii.

We've gotten to the point of the Wii U's life cycle where it's clear that owning the system, if you're serious about playing the best games on the market, has become mandatory.</blockquote>


Since _Mario Kart 8_ was released, I have had no problem making the Wii U my primary console. And while [I adore _Mario Kart 8_](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/01/hail-mary-o/), I'd argue that the Wii U is worth it for _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ alone. It is rich with content and polish, is gorgeous and challenging, and is one of the most innovative games I have ever played. The hits keep coming.

Aside from _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, _I'd argue against Kuchera and state that there haven't been any PS4 or Xbox One titles that have made me want to shell out for one or the other. And, again, outside of _Shadow of Mordor's_ Nemesis System, innovation and is something this new generation is severely lacking.
