[Ken Levine, creator of Bioshock, writing for Matter's _New York Review of Video Games_ feature](https://medium.com/matter/the-road-goes-ever-on-105f33453e55):

> There are two games that really kicked off what we think of as the modern “open world” game: _Super Mario 64_ and _Grand Theft Auto III_. These games unshackled the player from linear progression through a game’s levels. I think _Shadow of Mordor_ is the first “open narrative” game. You’re not just checking off missions in a variable sequence. You’re changing the dramatis personae. Whenever you succeed or fail, the characters in the story respond to your actions, and not in the manner of a branching “choose your own adventure.” It is an excessively simple, yet impressively flexible, crime story.
