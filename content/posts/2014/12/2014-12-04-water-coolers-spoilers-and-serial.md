On the way to work, my wife and I caught up on _[Serial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/serial/id917918570?mt=2)_. On our commute home, she mentioned that Zach Braff had tweeted about the podcast:


<blockquote>The [@serial](https://twitter.com/serial) podcast is an amazing articulation of stellar storytelling. I also love regular cereal.

I can't look through my Twitter feed without seeing a mention of _Serial_. Everyone's onboard. Everyone's got a take. But the extent of sharing is "OMG! WTF! #serial" We are all on par with Laura's confusion in episode 8.

_Serial_ is great. Definitely not my favorite podcast, but it's a spectacular display of fine editing and editorial guidance. But more importantly, _Serial_ has brought back the water cooler conversation. Everything about _Serial_ thus far is based on presumption. If you tried to explain what is happening, you'd leave behind mountains of critical detail. Because the questions hurdle by ad nauseam, there aren't answers big enough to spoil the show. Think _LOST_, with hatches and polar bears and Dharma, but rooted in the nonfiction investigation of a 1999 homicide case with cell records and reenactments and Jay. This is pre-meditated in the sense that Sarah Keonig and the _Serial_ crew know that answers won't come easy. There are no spoilers. This is great storytelling and we are along for the ride.

This thought led me to other serialized media. Serialized TV is larger than ever, but the good stuff (_Game of Thones_) is adapted or released in bulk (_House of Cards_). I kid, I kid. Admittedly, I have not watched _True Detective_. But in all seriousness, TiVo culture and binging has struck deep fear in sharing too much about nightly TV. While this sounds like a backwards argument against on-demand podcasts, again, Serial doesn't offer enough answers to divulge spoilers. Again, this is great storytelling.

This led me to thoughts on film. What was the last (semi-)pre-meditated, non-adapted, serialized film series released? _Pirates of the Caribbean _(2 & 3)? _The Matrix _(2 & 3)? _Star Wars _(5 & 6)? Nearly every (if not all) serialized film series released within the past few years has been adapted. _Harry Potter_. _Hunger Games_. _Divergent_. The answers to these series have been lying around in text years prior to the film's release. The best we can hope for is that we haven't read the book or the film is so far off from the source material that it feels like a unique experience.

We need more original, pre-meditated, serialized content. Someone write an original three part film trilogy with segments so good they can stand on their own as solid films. Someone conceptualize a three, four, or five season TV show from start to finish. Calculate the journey or take us along for the ride. Stop adapting. Stop playing by ear. If you do play by ear, root it in nonfiction. Make sure you can't make stuff up.

I realize this is less a message to creators as it is to producers, with overhead and risk to take into consideration. But if you want to give us story, allow us to risk _our_ time and money. Trust creators.

Tomorrow, my wife and I will listen to episode 10 of _Serial_ and the most we'll be able to share is "OMG! WTF! #serial"
