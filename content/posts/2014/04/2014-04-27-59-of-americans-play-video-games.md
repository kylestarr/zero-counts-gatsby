[Owen S. Good of Polygon on the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) 2014 Survey](http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/27/5658734/how-old-average-gamer-survey-study-consoles-mobile#230008991):


<blockquote>Other questions asked of the survey is whether parents view video games to be a positive part of their child's life; a majority — 56 percent — said yes, though some could view the figure as low given the nature of the question.</blockquote>


I’d say the 56% is positive and more than likely an upward trend seeing that the average gamer age is now 31. Most of today’s parents of 0~10 year-olds grew up with games. I believe they would likely state that games were a positive influence on their lives.

I’d like to think this sentiment is shared by adults who grew up with video games.
