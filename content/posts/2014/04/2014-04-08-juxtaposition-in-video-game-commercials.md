Textbook Tarantino or tired trope?

I recently re-entered the world of _BioShock's_ Rapture by means of _BioShock: Infinite's_ _Burial At Sea_ DLC. As I moved about the underwater city, full of the Gatsby-esque architectural stylings of Frank Lloyd Wright, I heard familiar sounds from the 20s-40s cascade through the setting.

At first, these genuinely warm pieces lulled me into a comfort juxtaposed against what eventually becomes a dark and grotesque atmosphere. Though, after roughly an hour, the presence of the pieces became more noticeable than they had seemed in my first play-through of the original _BioShock_. I pawned this off to the [Billie Holiday Pandora](http://thestarrlist.com/2013/01/10/top-5-timeless-pandora-stations/) station I've practically had on loop since that original play-through.

However, I began to wonder if the use of happy/soothing/serene/moving music juxtaposed against aggressive and bleak circumstances may be overstaying it's welcome. Just as quickly as I had decided to push this notion out of my mind, I heard news of the new [_Wolfenstein: The New Order_ trailer](http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/8/5592068/wolfenstein-the-new-order-gameplay-trailer) making use of Martha and The Vandellas hit "Nowhere to Run." While the song my not be strewn throughout the entirety of the trailer, it made me wonder if my initial inkling was correct.

I have decided to compile a list of many video game commercials that take advantage of this marketing approach, starting with _Super Smash Bros._ in 1999. This is likely nowhere near a complete list, merely an example of a marketing technique that is becoming less and less subtle.

Is this approach still effective or tired?
