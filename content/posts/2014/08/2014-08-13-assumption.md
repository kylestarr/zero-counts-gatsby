[Megan Farokhmanesh of Polygon, in conversation with Nate Fox of Sucker Punch, on the inclusion of Fetch as a playable character in Infamous: First Light](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/13/5997353/infamous-first-light-fetch-strong-female-lead):


<blockquote>Until now, Infamous has never given a female character a leading role. This was largely because of the assumption that "we thought that the demographic of game players were dudes and they identified with dudes," Fox said. He pointed to BioWare's Mass Effect series; [in 2011](http://www.vg247.com/2011/07/19/loving-femshep-biowares-first-lady-finally-steps-forward/), the developer said only 18 percent of players chose to play as a woman. That number was [reiterated](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-3-players-prefer-male-shepard/1100-6405842/) during a PAX East panel last year.</blockquote>


I love the admittance of assumption. Happy to see this message being spread throughout AAA Dev teams.
