[Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/07/29/peds.2013-4021.abstract):


<blockquote>Low levels (3 hours daily) of game engagement was linked to key indicators of psychosocial adjustment. Low engagement was associated with higher life satisfaction and prosocial behavior and lower externalizing and internalizing problems, whereas the opposite was found for high levels of play. No effects were observed for moderate play levels when compared with non-players.</blockquote>


It took me a second to wrap head around this. I wish the clearly defined moderate play. My interpretation:

- Less than 1 hour of play (low): Positive effects

- 0 (non-players) or 1-3 hours of play (moderate): No change

- More than 3 hours of play (high): Negative effects
