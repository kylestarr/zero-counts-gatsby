[Jack Moore on Mo’Ne Davis and Emma March](https://medium.com/the-cauldron/mone-davis-is-just-the-beginning-357bd054f391):


<blockquote>The narrative of the gimmick girl in sports is doubly damaging. Not only does it foster a lower expectation of women’s abilities — in both genders — it also creates an assumption that women aren’t earning their spots when in reality they are almost certainly facing even higher standards than the men they compete against.If the sports world is truly going to house gender equality, we need to give girls the freedom to choose their sports. We need to stop pressuring them to take the path of least gender resistance. And we need to stop holding them to a higher standard when everything else is already working against them.</blockquote>


Great read on gender equality in sports. Bring me right back to the [Finnish Hearthstone Tournament](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/07/02/finnish-hearthstone-tournament-limited-to-male-participants/) and [gender segregation in chess](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/07/11/how-chess-shows-that-gender-segregation-in-esports-might-encourage-more-female-leagues/). A very interesting conversation.
