<blockquote>It's actually more fascinating to watch the way that different fighters' complicated Ultra moves spread out, unobscured, across the stage. If you just want to see what the martial arts style of your favorite character looks like without the game's normal careful cutting, you can [click over to YouTube](http://youtu.be/zcEO77xw20I), where they're separated out with bookmarks.</blockquote>


I was just telling a colleague how much I wish I had learned 3D modeling and animation. This video drives my longing home.

On the topic of _Street Fighter_, take a few minutes to enjoy Pete Holmes' star-studded and hilarious [Street Fighter: Red Tape](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBIeL6Ot52KNc6o32LoddullcK_vpV1hT). Kumail Nanjiani's Dhalsim is tremendous.
