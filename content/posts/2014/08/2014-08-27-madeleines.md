['In loving memory of video games' by Chris Plante, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/27/6074135/video-game-memories):



<blockquote>They're my madeleines, you could say, transporting me back to the days my love of video games was personal and private, only shared with the neighbor kids and never ever disclosed at school, where it would have been taken for a weakness. The world has changed.</blockquote>



A beautiful piece by Plante.
