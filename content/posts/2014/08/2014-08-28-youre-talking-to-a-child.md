[David Auerbach, Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/08/zoe_quinn_harassment_a_letter_to_a_young_male_gamer.html):


<blockquote>Now a harder suggestion: Police yourselves. When an impetuous member of Anonymous “revealed” the wrong person as Michael Brown’s shooter, [many other members aggressively and publicly condemned the member](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/08/14/how-anonymous-got-it-right-and-wrong-in-ferguson/). You’ve got to do that, too. When the more infantile and hateful members of the online gaming contingent harass a woman, you should remind them what the actual goal is, and tell them that they’re tripping themselves up. Remember that you’re talking to a child, in spirit if not in actual fact. If you police yourselves, Reddit and Steam moderators won’t have to. This is not an easy task, but it _is_ possible. Self-organizing communities are one of the miracles of human civilization.</blockquote>
