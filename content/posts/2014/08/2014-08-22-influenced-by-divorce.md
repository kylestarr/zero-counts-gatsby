[Joe Russ, developer of Jenny LeClue, as quote by Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/21/6053163/jenny-leclue-divorce):


<blockquote>Growing up in a family of divorce is all about choices, and how your parents' choices can greatly affect you â€” at least as much as them. It's about accepting that sometimes the right choices have tough consequences.

These are the things I want players to be able to explore in the game and be part of in writing the narrative with us. Growing up is about making these choices and learning to live with the consequences. Becoming an adult is, for me, about understanding that you have responsibility for your actions.</blockquote>


Divorce is an interesting well of inspiration. This concept sounds intriguing. Looking forward to playing [Jenny LeClue](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mografi/jenny-leclue-a-handmade-adventure-game/).
