[Dennis Scimeca, The Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/shocking-truth-behind-the-quinnspiracy/):


<blockquote>One of the complaints is that if Quinn were a man who slept with women supposedly for influence, the games press would have been all over the story instead of remaining silent and ignoring the story out of fear they’ll be tarred with accusations of sexism.

Au contraire. Were the story about a man sleeping with [women](http://www.dailydot.com/tags/women) it would be even less of a story. Readers would virtually high-five the male developer because we celebrate male sexuality and punish female [sexuality](http://www.dailydot.com/tags/sexuality) in our culture.

Don’t take my word for it. There’s decades of scholarly research to demonstrate the point. But it’s kind of a lost cause to ask these audience members to bother with research. [Anita Sarkeesian](http://dailydot.com/tags/anita-sarkeesian) has produced some of the [best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6p5AZp7r_Q)-[researched and documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i_RPr9DwMA) studies of sexism in video games out there. Her critics accuse her of “cherry-picking” her data, however, which boggles the mind.</blockquote>
