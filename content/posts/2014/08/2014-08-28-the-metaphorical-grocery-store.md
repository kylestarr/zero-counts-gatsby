[Chris Plante, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/28/6078391/video-games-awful-week):


<blockquote>Two groups are at opposite ends of this moment:

One side has folded its arms, slumped its shoulders while pouting like an obstinate child that has learned they are getting a little brother or sister but wants to remain the singular focus of his parents' affection.

The other side has opened its arms, unable to contain its love and compassion, because they understand they are no longer alone.

This week, the obstinate child threw a temper tantrum, and the industry was stuck in the metaphorical grocery store as everyone was forced to suffer through it together. But unlike a child, the people behind these temper tantrums are hurting others. It's time to grow up. Let's not wait until next week to start.</blockquote>


I am very happy to see writers [Auerbach](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/08/28/youre-talking-to-a-child/) and Plante echo each other's sentiment of "childish rhetoric." I'm even happier that Plante is escalating this conversation to include the reality of the situation.
