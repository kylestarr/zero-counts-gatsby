[Colin Campbell, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/13/5999317/heres-why-i-wont-be-playing-journey-on-playstation-4):


<blockquote>Already, just playing a few minutes of Journey on PlayStation 4, I'm reminded that the moment-to-moment playing of the game is not as mystical as the memory of it as a complete thing. That the first time I meet another player in the game is never going to match the joyous original. The nice feeling of the wind is just an echo of that last section of the game, that wraps it all up so satisfactorily.</blockquote>


I often tell myself that I will take another trip through the work of art that is _Journey_. After all, the experience only lasts roughly one-and-a-half hours. However, every time I sit down to try, I'm unable to launch the game for the same reasons Campbell discusses. I do listen to [Austin Wintory's fantastic, Grammy-nominated soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/journey-original-soundtrack/id511359368) frequently and I think it is enough for me to relive the majesty and memory of _Journey_.
