[Russ Frushtick](http://www.polygon.com/forums/meta/2014/8/22/6056993/goodbye-polygon-said-frushtick):


<blockquote>But, there comes a day when you feel like you're not learning as much as you were, or you're not conquering as many new challenges as you used to. Even with awesome, amazing jobs like this, there comes a time when you feel like you need to try something fresh. Something new. That's been buzzing in my ear for the last few months and, as of two weeks ago, I let my boss, Chris Grant, know that I was taking the leap. (He was super cool about it, by the way.)</blockquote>


I've always enjoyed Frushtick's work. Sad to see him leave Polygon and the games media-at-large but happy to see him leave on his own terms. Godspeed Frushtick. Looking forward to the August [Besties](https://itun.es/us/1lziE.c) more than ever.

_UPDATE, 5/3/16_: [Russ is back](http://www.polygon.com/forums/meta/2016/5/3/11579970/hello-again):


<blockquote>It's been nearly two years since I left and an educational two years at that. I took a break from the gaming industry and expanded into new areas. I wanted to broaden my professional experience, get out of my comfort zone, and dive into some new things. I worked with some great companies and great people but there was always a tugging. A desire to return to return to this place and work with these amazing people.</blockquote>


Great news. And what does this mean for the future of Besties?
