[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/12/7204429/assassins-creed-unity-launch-driveclub):


<blockquote>This is how publishers should begin looking at their launches: Players with set time and budget concerns are looking for reasons not to buy a game, and the better your game works at launch, the more reasons we have to pick it up.

There is always a choice to be had, even if that choice consists of playing the things we haven't yet finished. A bad launch takes you out of the running, and stressed-out players may almost be happy to see you go.

This is another reason why [pre-ordering games is a terrible idea](http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/10/5887425/aliens-isolation-ripley-preorder-exclusive-no), and [waiting to buy is so smart](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/20/6049157/Diablo-3-new-releases-wait-patience). If you're not locked into a purchase you can simply buy another game, or wait for things to become more stable. There are people who ran out to pick up Unity yesterday only to get to work and read the reviews. Or worse yet  they opened it, played it and are now stuck with a product they can't return.</blockquote>


A simpler way to read [yesterday's rant](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/11/11/embargoes-and-appetites/).
