[Yours truly, June 23, 2014](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/23/siracusa-on-the-end-of-humanity/):



<blockquote>There have been many arguments about the term “video game” and what it actually means in today’s world. Many “games” no longer incorporate elements of games (e.g. _Journey_), causing critics to coin terms like “interactive experiences.” I think Siracusa’s talk shines light on a better word for modern games (especially first-person design) that has been right under our noses: Simulations.

There are games (e.g. _Super Mario Bros._, _Uncharted_), there are simulations (e.g. _Journey_, _Dear Esther_, _Gran Turismo_), and there are those that incorporate both (e.g. _Halo_, _Mario Kart_). The problem is that no one wants to hear the term “simulation.” For most, simulations have been boring since _Flight Simulator 2000_. On the other hand, games have been fun for centuries.

As we move closer to an Oculus future, we move further away from “video games.” If anything, I’d argue that the term “video game” does more harm than good for the industry’s larger appeal, carrying the baggage of a childish activity regardless of [what studies show](https://tsogaming.com/2014/04/27/59-of-americans-play-video-games/). “Simulation” may not be perfect the perfect term but it’s a word that should be incorporated more often.</blockquote>



In any case, a very enjoyable argument from Jamin Warren and PBS.
