[Paul Tassi writing for Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/11/16/a-40m-ad-budget-buys-game-of-war-fire-age-kate-upton/):


<blockquote>It just seems like a strange pairing, and I think if Upton or her support staff understood the industry more, they’d realize that Game of War is a relatively spammy title compared to other offerings in the video game industry, and rather beneath one of the most famous supermodels in the world. Though I suppose what was almost certainly a multimillion dollar paycheck for no more than a few day’s work will draw all the kind words the game requires.

It’s an interesting, unsettling age we live in where games can be bad by nearly anyone’s standards, but still be hugely profitable with enough marketing to herd easily-addicted players toward a microtransaction-stuffed title. It seems to be working quite well with Game of War, but I’m not sure how long these kinds of titles can continue to find success, as they seem to have a short shelf life once players get tired of being milked endlessly.</blockquote>


While I find the [_Game of War_ marketing campaign](https://twitter.com/kateupton/status/533783486432157696) adolescent and lazy, I don't have a problem with Upton being placed in ads or the game itself any more than I do Kevin Spacey in _Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare_. I'm sure she was offered a fine deal for her likeness. In-game celebrity is something we should be getting used to. (Peter Dinklage voiceover in _Destiny_, _Kim Kardashian: Hollywood_)

Regarding Tassi's thoughts on the longevity of "these kinds of titles", _Transformers: Age of Extinction_ grossed $1.09B. Bay's _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ grossed $474.4M. I hope you see what I'm getting at here. And I'm a huge TMNT fan.

**UPDATE**: It looks like _Game of War_ has released [a new version of their Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/gameofwar/status/535573448064397312), reading "Will you be the hero?" vs. "Will you be my hero?" Note that the banner image differs as well, with less of an upfront focus on Upton. Context suggests "the" seems more in-line than "my", but is this a variant or a rebrand?
