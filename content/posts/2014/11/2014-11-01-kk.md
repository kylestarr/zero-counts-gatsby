I married the woman of my dreams today. She is challenging and fierce; exuberant and loving. She has improved my perspective on life and attitude toward myself more than any other. She has taught me to love food and jazz and design; important things that require planning but leave room for spontaneity to fill the cracks. She has shown me the importance of patience and slowing down; enjoying a good cup of coffee and a solid read before the workday. She has opened my eyes to a side of life I thought only existed in insanely impossible Nora Ephron films. She is my mentor, my biggest supporter, and my lover. And I am Mrs. Kelley Clarke Starr's biggest fan.
