Polygon's Quality Control is a fantastic short-form podcast hosted by Justin McElroy in which video game reviewers (primarily from Polygon) offer insight to their review of a particular new release and answer listener questions.

[On today's episode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/polygons-quality-control/id925059601?mt=2#episodeGuid=tag%3Asoundcloud%2C2010%3Atracks%2F176443514), Polygon Reviews Editor and guest Arthur Gies elaborated on [his review of _Assassin's Creed: Unity_](http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/11/7192467/assassins-creed-unity-review-xbox-one-PS4-PC).

Upon reading Gies's review, I was taken aback by the lack of mention to [the E3 hubbub](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/11/no-females-in-assassins-creed-unity-co-op/) surrounding Ubisoft creative director Alex Amancio's comments regarding the lack of playable female avatar's in co-op:



<blockquote>It's double the animations, it's double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets. Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work.</blockquote>



I posed the following unabridged question to Justin via email:

"Arthur seemed to avoid the elephant-in-the-room regarding female playable characters in co-op. While Polygon (and Arthur) has/have made sexualization and representation an impetus for review scores in the past (see Bayonetta 2 (albeit, on the opposite side of representation)), why was this not addressed? Did Arthur feel that female representation did not affect AC: Unity's overall review? Did he feel the damage had already been done and no more worthwhile discussion could be added? Or was it that Arthur simply wanted us focus solely on the end-product, sharing the detail we may miss when distracted by the elephant?"

Arthur's response, time stamp 8:20, edited for clarity:



<blockquote>I mean Arno is the character in the game. And I don't think women are treated particularly well in the game; It's certainly not even close to the most egregious misstep that I've seen in a game this year with regard to that kind of subject matter. And honestly, the game has so many other problems to discuss that at a certain point I feel like I'm running out of reader patience or attention span to get to the heart of the statement that I'm trying to make.

With _Assassin's Creed: Unity_, the traversal problems that the series has had for years and the massive technical issues and a really underwhelming story are all things that undermine _Unity_ very seriously. I could go on at length at various things in the game that bother me but those are the most substantive things that hurt the game. It could still have been a fantastic game despite the absence of women in it as playable avatars. [If that were the case], that might have been a discussion I could have had, but that wasn't as material as everything else.</blockquote>



Thanks for the time and clarity, Arthur.
