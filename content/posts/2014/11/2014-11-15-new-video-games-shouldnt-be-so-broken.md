[Luke Plunkett, Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/new-video-games-shouldnt-be-so-broken-1658570535):


<blockquote>I get that making games is hard. That publishers force deadlines on teams, that accounting for millions of players is rough work, that a myriad of technical complexities mean completely eradicating bugs is an impossible task.

As a paying customer, though, I just don't care anymore. Why? Because right now, the blockbuster video game industry is taking more than it's giving back.</blockquote>


Another good read about the growing trend of broken games, the need for bigger testing budgets, and the call not to pre-order games.

Plunkett continues:



<blockquote>If a car, or DVD, or rice-cooker, or phone, or basically anything else launched with significant parts not working, or not working as well as advertised, it'd be slammed. People would demand their money back, and they would get it, because there is an expectation that when you pay money for something, it works.</blockquote>



[My similar thoughts](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/11/11/embargoes-and-appetites/) from November 11, 2014 below:



<blockquote>This does not, however, address the problem of protection from broken product. This is not film or musicâ€” botched playback would never escape manufacturing; a bad bounce would never escape the studio. Pre-orders for products so deeply rooted in real-time mechanics and engineering, notoriously subjected to time crunches and annual release dates, cannot wisely be considered for pre-order without subjection to reviews. While I implore patiently waiting for reviews on this type of product, release date and post-release date embargo lifts, as Kuchera implies, are cowardly and bullshit.</blockquote>
