[Danielle Riendeau of Polygon in an _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ producer and director Koichi Hayashida and Shinya Hiratake](http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/17/7232863/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-super-mario-nintendo):


<blockquote>"We began with _[Super Mario 64](http://www.polygon.com/game/super-mario-64/4113)_," Hayashida told Polygon via video conference. "While _Super Mario 64_ was quite an interesting game, we heard that roughly 20 percent of gamers found it too difficult," he said, brandishing a copy of the Nintendo 64 game. "We kept that comment that the game was too challenging and made games like _Super Mario 3D Land_ and _Super Mario 3D World_ with that in mind."

But, in making _3D Land_ and _3D World_, the team felt it was getting away from a fundamental design principle that made _Mario 64_ so special: the idea that the levels were a sort of "diorama" or a "garden in a box," entire worlds contained in relatively compact structures. In creating the Captain Toad stages for _Mario 3D World_, the studio was able to go back to that idea, and keep the challenge level accessible.

That's how the team created the handful of stages starring Captain Toad for _Super Mario 3D World_. They represented a different style of play from the traditional 3D platforming in the rest of the game — slower paced and more cerebral, they offered players something of a refresher between obstacle courses and cat-powered wackiness.</blockquote>


In addition to the variety of interesting cross-overs and spin-offs, it seems like Nintendo has been a bit more open as of late, [offering more peaks](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/09/interview_eiji_aonuma_and_yosuke_hayashi_on_hyrule_warriors_and_shigeru_miyamotos_definitive_role) [behind the certain](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/18/5-things-we-learned-about-mario-kart-8s-dlc).

As for Captain Toad, I love that _Super Mario 64_ stands as its foundation. However, my favorite part of _Super Mario 64_ is the challenge. It is always great to take a swing at impossibly difficult missions year after year. There is almost a "young grasshopper" feel to it. I hope _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker's_ accessible "challenge level" isn't too far removed from _Super Mario 64_.

Either way, this interview solidifies my thought that [Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is genius](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/11/captain-toad-is-genius/).
