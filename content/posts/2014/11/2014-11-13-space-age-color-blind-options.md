Awesome accessibility awareness. And top level too. (Tap Options on the title screen and there they are!) That alone earned Big Bucket Software [my $3.99](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/11/12/ustwo-offers-8-new-monument-valley-chapters-for-1-99-gets-hammered-with-1-star-reviews/).

_Space Age: A Cosmic Adventure_ is currently available for [iOS](https://appsto.re/us/RFM-2.i). Looking forward to playing. Also hearing great things about [the soundtrack by Cabel Sasser](https://itun.es/us/lJw43).
