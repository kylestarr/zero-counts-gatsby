[Björn Jeffery, Toca Boca](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story):


<blockquote>Making apps for children: it's not a perfect science, it's more like art. This is sort of shaping kids' memories of them growing up. That's a big responsibility. That's something we should be taking very seriously.</blockquote>


A big responsibility [indeed](https://twitter.com/_kylestarr/status/466586455167758336).

'App: The Human Story' looks to be an extremely compelling, promising and well crafted documentary about the history and future of apps. The roster isn't half bad either.
