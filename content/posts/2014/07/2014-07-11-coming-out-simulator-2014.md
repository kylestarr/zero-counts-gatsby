[A half-true game about half-truths.](http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014)

[Danielle Riendeau, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/11/5887909/coming-out-simulator-2014-gay-gaming):


<blockquote>No matter how many pride parades I attend, or how much volunteer work I do, or how long I live in the generally accepting city of San Francisco, a part of me will always be that terrified 17-year-old, worried that her family won't love her any more. Case' game hit me _right there_.</blockquote>


Just completed a play-through. In the span of 10 minutes, I felt my blood boil, heart race, and gut wrench. Very brave and inspiring sim. Brought me back to [this post](http://tsogaming.com/2014/07/01/bioware-intros-first-gay-male-character/).

Well done, Nicky Case.
