[Keith Stuart, The Gaurdian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/playstation-4-vs-xbox-one-the-console-war-that-turned-into-a-love-story?CMP=ema_565):


<blockquote>Perhaps the newfound respect is a sign that the industry has matured. The average age of a gamer now is 35, and you can't refuse to talk to the marketing executive at your firm because they own an Xbox One not a PlayStation 4 so they smell. At the same time, consoles are no longer the kings of the gaming block. Smartphones have created a massive new audience of casual players, and the PC has had something of a renaissance thanks to the Steam digital games service and the rise of indie developments like Minecraft. It's not me v you in consoles anymore, it's us v them.

In some ways it's a shame. Great game design, great art even (OK, let's not go there right now), is born from conflict and chaos, not from cosy chats and shared admiration. Grudging respect is fine, but I half yearn for the days when we spent so long with our consoles of choice that they became part of our identity, and identity is always forged in opposition.</blockquote>


I don't think we can be so naïve to think that the "console war" discussions of old are not still happening behind closed doors. I believe the PR for both companies are wise to the impact of negative, name-calling campaigns under the magnifying glass of social media. They are also likely to avoid the same negative lambasting mirrored in online communities, a now infamous trait of the video game industry.

Perhaps the biggest reason the battle has turned into "us v them" goes back to the HD Twins conversation. Both consoles are so strikingly similar (especially now, with the removal of DRM and Kinect from Xbox One) that there isn't much weight behind console v console jabs. If anything, this argument now lives on in the HD Twins v Wii U conversation.

To add, the 2014 E3 press conferences for both Sony and Microsoft appeared to mirror the other's message from the previous year. In 2013, Sony was heavy handed on games. In 2014, that message was [delivered by Microsoft](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/10/microsoft-at-e3/). Likewise, Microsoft's 2013 E3 messaging was miscellaneous media services such as all-in-one entertainment and exclusive TV shows. This appeared to be the underlying message in [Sony's 2014 conference](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/10/only-on-playstation-bro/).

Lastly, as if I haven't spoken of it enough, [Console Wars by Blake J. Harris](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062276697/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062276697&linkCode=as2&tag=tpv07-20&linkId=HZBFV4VJ24DV4R4G) is an entertaining read about the Nintendo v Sega console wars during the late '80s / early '90s. Worth your while.
