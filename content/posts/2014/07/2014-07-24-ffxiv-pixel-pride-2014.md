To celebrate [the addition of same-sex marriages](http://tsogaming.com/2014/06/11/final-fantasy-14-gets-same-sex-marriage/) in _Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn_, the Rough Trade Gaming Community took to the streets of Eorzea in the inaugural FFXIV Pixel Pride parade.

[J. Bryan Lowder, Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/07/22/watch_a_video_game_pride_parade_courtesy_of_final_fantasy_and_the_rough.html):


<blockquote>I must say, having watched both the real thing [Pride Parade in New York City] back in June and now this, the Rough Trade parade seemed—pixilation aside—the more joyous of the two.</blockquote>
