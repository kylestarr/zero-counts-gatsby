[Time](http://time.com/3051693/zoe-saldana-guardians-of-the-galaxy-space/):


<blockquote>Hollywoodâ€™s woman problem is well-documented: [researchers at San Diego State University found](http://time.com/19007/lena-dunham-has-a-point-new-research-documents-hollywoods-sexism/) that women made up just 15% of protagonists, 29% of major characters and 30% of all speaking characters in movies last year.</blockquote>
