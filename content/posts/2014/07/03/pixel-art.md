A great post at The Verge today. Pixel art is and forever will be the most emblematic representation of the video game medium.

Adam Saltsman, creator of _Canabalt_:

After Nintendo released _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D_ in 2011 (a remastering of 1998's original _LoZ: OoT_), many were quick to point out that it had been rebuilt as the game you remember, not the game it actually was. Our imaginations have the wondrous ability to fill in blanks and fill out details that may not actually be there. This seems to be the reason I have no quandary with the evolution of Mario. I have never questioned this:

Red cap, mustache, overalls? Sure, that's Mario.
