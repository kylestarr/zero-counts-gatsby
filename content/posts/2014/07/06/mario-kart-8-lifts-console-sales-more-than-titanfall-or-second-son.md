[Tim Ellis, GeekWire](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/mario-kart-8-bigger-system-seller-titanfall-second-son/):

<blockquote>According to console sales data from[VGChartz](http://www.vgchartz.com/), Nintendo was selling an average of about 29,000 Wii U consoles per week prior to Mario Kart 8′s release. The week Mario Kart 8 hit store shelves, over 130,000 Wii U consoles were sold. Even three weeks after the release, sales were still more than double their pre-[Luigi-Death-Stare](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/luigis-death-stare) levels. All-told, Mario Kart 8 has sold an additional 207,000 Wii U consoles in just three weeks.
> 
> But it gets even more interesting when you compare the Wii U’s big system-seller with the exclusives that have come out in the first half of 2014 on the other two consoles.
> 
> March saw the release of both Titanfall for Xbox One and inFAMOUS: Second Son for Playstation 4. The sales boost from Titanfall only lasted two weeks and moved about 94,000 additional Xbox One consoles. The sales boost from the Seattle-set Second Son lasted three weeks and moved an additional 106,000 PlayStation 4 consoles.
