Relive the biggest plays from the 2014 World Cup with [Matheus Toscano's 8bit Football blog](http://8bit-football.com).

[Toscano, as quoted by The Verge](http://theverge.com/2014/7/14/5897753/all-the-world-cups-biggest-moments-in-striking-8-bit-drawings):


<blockquote>People want to see how their favorite players and teams would look like in 8-bit style. Whenever they can recognize someone, even if it is only represented by only a few pixels, that usually makes them laugh.

Most people who grew up in the ’80s and ’90s could experience playing football video games with such graphics. Whenever we see something similar, it brings back memories from childhood.</blockquote>


Worth relinking to my previous post on [pixel art](https://tsogaming.com/2014/07/03/pixel-art/).
