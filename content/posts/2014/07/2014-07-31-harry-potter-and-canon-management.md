[Variety](http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/warner-bros-conjures-up-harry-potter-global-franchise-development-team-1201271814/):


<blockquote>Warner Bros. Entertainment has conjured up the [Harry Potter](http://variety.com/t/harry-potter/) Global Franchise Development team, based in both London and Burbank, to “develop and execute a high-level strategic vision for the Harry Potter brand and its ancillary businesses,” Warner Bros. said Wednesday.</blockquote>


We've seen similar strategies with the Lord of the Rings ([Middle-earth Enterprises](http://middleearth.com)) and Star Wars (Lucasfilm Story Group) franchises. I am all for unified canon management and more Harry Potter. Seems like great news for a potential Harry Potter MMO...
