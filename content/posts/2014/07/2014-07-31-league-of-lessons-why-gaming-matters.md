Great read on connecting from Wiseman.
[Rosalind Wiseman, Anti-Defamation League](http://www.adl.org/education-outreach/curriculum-resources/c/league-of-lessons-why-gaming.html):


<blockquote>Young people who game know our bias and the ignorance this bias comes from. It’s this reactivity about games that can make it much more difficult for us to develop strong relationships with young people. It’s also undeniable that gaming is an essential part of many students’ lives. We have an obligation to know about this incredibly diverse world so we can effectively help children and teens navigate it with informed, constructive guidance.</blockquote>
