[Jeffrey Jaques, writer and illustrator of Questionable Content, as quoted by The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/14/single-player-gamers-destiny-solo-activision-grand-theft-forza):


<blockquote>Playing with jerks, is no fun. Having a stoned college kid tell me I suck and can’t fucking shoot when I’m just learning an FPS is no fun. Being stuck at level 40 in World of Warcraft when all my friends are level 60 and don’t have time to help me catch up is no fun. Having to play any multiplayer game for 25 hours a week to remain competitive ... that's not fun, that's an unpaid part-time job.</blockquote>


Likewise, I don't have 40 spare hours to dedicate to the story of a single game. I grew up awed by Final Fantasy and dreamt of having the time to play a full story. Since seeing _FFVII_, I've completed two: _FFX_ and _FFXIII_.

I'm coming to find that games with dailies such as _Hearthstone_ or with "three star" achievements such as (famously) _Angry Birds_ or _Mario Kart 8_ allow for quicker bouts of manageable playtime.
