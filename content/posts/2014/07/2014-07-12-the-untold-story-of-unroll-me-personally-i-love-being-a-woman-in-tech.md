[Perri Blake Gorman, co-founder of Unroll.Me](https://medium.com/@bethebutterfly/the-road-to-a-million-users-aa591e54a8a7):


<blockquote>Personally I love being a woman in tech. There is nothing that has helped me be more memorable than being a woman. Our first piece of press happened when Courtney Boyd Meyers (@CBM), then at The Next Web, reached out to us. She asked to write a piece because she had seen me tweeting about it. As a female founder you get on peopleâ€™s radars. That press was followed by a post by Lifehacker which generated over 26,000 signups in 24 hours.</blockquote>


A great outlook on the ongoing and magnified diversity problem in the tech (and gaming) industry. Just unsubscribed from 85 newsletters, rolled up 29. My favorite part are the Most Unsubscribed / Most Rolled Up [awards](https://unroll.me/awards).
