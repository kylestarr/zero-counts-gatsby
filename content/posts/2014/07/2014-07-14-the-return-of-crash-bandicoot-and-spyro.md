[Andrew House on Crash Bandicoot and Spyro, as quoted by Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/playstation/10962258/Bring-back-Crash-Bandicoot-I-definitely-wouldnt-close-the-door-on-that.html):


<blockquote>In concept, it is something we’ve been thinking about and discussing, and this is a shift for us. We’ve started to say that maybe there isn’t anything wrong with going back and looking at characters that people still talk about, that were a big part of their childhood or their youth. I definitely wouldn’t close the door on that.</blockquote>


[I've](https://tsogaming.com/2014/06/19/rare-and-lionhead-are-crown-jewels/) [mentioned](https://tsogaming.com/2014/05/16/rare-is-evaluating-what-to-do-after-kinect-says-phil-spencer-polygon/) [before](https://tsogaming.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-swinging-for-the-franchise-fences-with-rare-ip/) that Microsoft needs to invest in aged Rare IP such as _Banjo-Kazooie_, _Jet Force Gemini_, and _Conker_ (now coming to _Project Spark_). Blinded by their "success," I however neglected Sony's need to do the same.

It goes without saying that Nintendo is on [the](https://tsogaming.com/2014/06/12/mario-kart-is-moving-units/) [upswing](https://tsogaming.com/2014/07/05/mario-kart-8-lifts-console-sales-more-than-titanfall-or-second-son/). The value of their family friendly franchises are at the heart of why you can never count them out of the console race.

Mascots are identity. At the very least, Microsoft can lean on Master Chief but that only scores them a slice of the audience. (Granted a very big slice.) Sony has... Nathan Drake? Kratos? Sackboy and Sly Cooper are nice and all but hardly recognizable outside of Sony diehards. This all became very apparent with the release of [Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_All-Stars_Battle_Royale).

Nintendo's franchises, like Disney's, are approaching timelessness. As the HD Twins continue to struggle in setting themselves apart, Nintendo is only going to gain foothold with releases that focus on familiar faces. Microsoft and Sony need to adopt color and a little family franchise flair.

I'm sad to hear that working with _Crash Bandicoot_ and _Spyro_ would be "a shift" for Sony, but good on House for acknowledging this question. Great on Telegraph for asking.

**Update**: [Prior to the launch of Sonic The Hedgehog 2 ,circa 1992, as excerpted from "Console Wars" by Blake J, Harris](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=718597648):



<blockquote>According to a recent national survey, Sonic was now a more recognizable American icon than Mario, MC Hammer, and even Mickey Mouse.</blockquote>
