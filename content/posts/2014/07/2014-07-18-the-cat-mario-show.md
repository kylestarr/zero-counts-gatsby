In 1988, Nintendo distributed a first-party magazine called _Nintendo Power_ full of reviews, previews, strategies, and tips and tricks. With the eShop channel, and programs like _The Cat Mario Show_, Nintendo seems to have found a great alternative to the magazine.

I'm very happy to see a focus put back on tips and tricks. Bolting to drug store magazine aisles to read _GamePro_, _Nintendo Power_, and _EGM_ while on errands with my family remains one of my fondest memories. I remember flipping directly to the tips and tricks sections to see if any of the games I owned were being featured. In the event I found on, I'd scribble down the code or attempt to embed the button combinations into my muscle memory. In all honesty, clever tips and tricks were enough to sell me on a games I did not own; more so than actual previews and reviews.
