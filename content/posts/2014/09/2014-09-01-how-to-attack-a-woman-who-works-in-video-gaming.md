[Jenn Frank, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/01/how-to-attack-a-woman-who-works-in-video-games):


<blockquote>See, the best, most successful hate campaign dreams big. For some, it isn’t only about targeting one woman, two women, or a handful of women. The endgame is to frighten all women out of the video games industry – no matter what they write, film, create or produce – and to additionally frighten anyone who would support them.</blockquote>
