[John Archer, writing for Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2014/09/12/the-ps4-and-xbox-one-are-already-out-of-date/):


<blockquote>What every single person who gets caught up in these hilariously petty arguments fails to recognise is that actually the PS4 and Xbox One are both past their sell by dates. In fact, they’ve been living on borrowed time from the very day they launched. Why? Because neither of them truly support 4K.

This argument might initially seem a stretch to ‘normal’ people not involved day to day in the inner workings of the AV industry. But I’m confident that within as little as 12 months most of you will agree that their inability to deliver games at a ‘4K’ or Ultra High Definition (UHD) resolution of 3840×2160 pixels – or something close to it, at least – will make both the supposedly ‘next generation’ consoles feel like yesterday’s news.</blockquote>


I don't know anything about John Archer or his qualifications so I take his opinion about 4K penetration with a grain of salt. However, I would love to believe that 4K will be taking the speedy and monumental strides Archer claims. Relinking to [my (premature) excitement about the adoption of 4K](https://www.zerocounts.net/2013/01/08/2013-the-year-of-4k/).

But where does this fit in with console gaming? Contrary to Archer's argument, I don't believe the core console gamer will put up much of a fuss as long as 1080 is the maximum render their console of choice offers. If anything, there will be a continued and tired assault from PC gaming enthusiasts as to why this is a sign that PC gaming is better. Though he's speaking on the software front, I believe the points made Polygon's [Chris Grant on console software's generational obsolesce](https://www.zerocounts.net/2013/10/18/whats-it-like-to-build-a-pc-polygon-friends-list-10142013/) are relevant.

I won't lie and pretend that the resolution differences between the Xbox One and PS4 don't bug me. Even if a huge difference between the two can hardly be seen, there is discomfort in knowing that the specs of the Xbox One can't quite keep up with the PS4. This coming from a guy that continued to enjoy the original Wii long into the PS3/Xbox 360 cycle. But when the difference is as stark as two-fold, graphical comparison must be shelved and each individual system taken on it's own merits. _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_ was a hell of a sight on Wii. Likewise, _The Last of Us_ seemed to be on another level against other PS3 titles. That said, it is a far cry from saying core gamers will be upset about not performing at 4K if neither of the HD Twins can perform at that rate.

I won't hold my breath, but wouldn't it be something if the Wii U's successor rendered 4K resolutions in time for the [next-gen Legend of Zelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_1059969563&feature=iv&src_vid=gTMhGg5mtp8&v=VcYXX4TUK4I)?
