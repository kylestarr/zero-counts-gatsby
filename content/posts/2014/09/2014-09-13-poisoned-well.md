[Zoe Quinn, as quoted by The Guardian, on Gamergate](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/12/zoe-quinn-gamergate-online-hate-mobs-depression-quest):


<blockquote>I think right now the well is incredibly poisoned: it’s likely a losing battle and that’s incredibly disappointing. I also feel like discussing ethics and fairness is antithetical to a campaign originated in and motivated by a fair bit of misogyny and harassment.</blockquote>


Does it say anything that my Twitter usage, gaming news consumption, and overall web browsing is down by a considerable amount? 

It is exhausting to think that digital mobs and trolls may never be stopped due to the anonymous and unquantifiable nature of the digital space. I was young and dumb too, saying things in Quake and Starcraft chat rooms that were likely horrific by today's standards. But I was an in monitored child. It wasn't until real classroom debate, introduction to socially aware music and film, and being called out for my idiocy in person by a respected peer that I wised up. 

Is that what we are dealing with? Are these children? Adults? Are they bluffing for fun? How many are there? A handful? Dozens? Hundreds? What failed their social growth?

In the real world, we can identify the source of seemingly monstrous shadows. In the digital world, shadows are the source.
