[Mojang.com, regarding Microsoft's Minecraft acquisition](https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/):


<blockquote>It was reassuring to see how many of your opinions mirrored those of the Mojangstas when we heard the news. Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us. Itâ€™s going to be good though. Everything is going to be OK. <3</blockquote>
