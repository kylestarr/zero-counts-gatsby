[Mackenzie Craven, Rose Gold Lining](http://rosegoldlining.com/2014/08/i-have-breast-cancer/):


<blockquote>Let’s rewind. I’m 26 years old. Freshly married. And healthy! That young, dumb kind of healthy that convinces you it’s okay to only see the doctor when you need a prescription filled. You drink green smoothies and run half marathons, therefore you’re untouchable – right? Life has been good in this blissful, newlywed, dumb-healthy bubble – perfect, even. Filled with morning coffee and walks to the farmers market hand-in-hand with my husband, Kenny. Bike rides to the breweries, hikes with our dog Hugo. I ate the chia seeds and I wore out my running shoes, so I was completely blindsided by my diagnosis. I have breast cancer?</blockquote>


Brilliant, brave, and honest. One of the best pieces I've ever read. Take a moment to read and appreciate this woman's work. #KenzieKicksCancer
