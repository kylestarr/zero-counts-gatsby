[Peter Cohen, iMore](http://www.imore.com/nsfw-apple-u2-and-looking-gift-horse-mouth):


<blockquote>These days the Internet Rage Machine swings into overdrive at the drop of a hat. Everyone uses almost every excuse to get angry about whatever they can. Because rage drives traffic, and traffic can drive revenue when you run a web site that's dependent on page impressions and unique visits to generate traffic for advertisers. For some people, it's all about going viral and getting eyes on your pages.

And for others, it's just about venting your spleen because it's the Internet, and that's what people do because they're angry all the damn time or they just want to be heard and acknowledged.</blockquote>


Context aside, Cohen crushes Internet rage. If you're going to offer feedback, positive or negative, make it specific and constructive. If you're going to vomit nonsensical ignorance/hate/rage, don't. I'mÂ done listening.
