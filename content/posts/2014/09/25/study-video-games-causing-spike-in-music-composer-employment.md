[Taylor Soper, GeekWire](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/study-video-games-causing-spike-music-composer-employment/):

> SoundCon found that the number of composing jobs remained flat until 2009, when growth in the space took off. As the graph above shows, SoundCon found that the dramatic increase was largely due to the arrival of Apple’s App Store and the Facebook Application Developer.

I can't help but feel Austin Wintory's Grammy nomination for the Journey OST will help inspire others as well. However, a paycheck is nice too…
