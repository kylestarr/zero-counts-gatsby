An all-star roster of games journalists joined Adam Rosser on [BBC Radio 5 live's Game On](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/game-on-social-justice-warriors/id581875435?i=318409590&mt=2) for a discussion on the "social justice warrior." Some of my favorite moments below:

Pat Garratt, VG247:


<blockquote>I've seen many squabbles on the Internet and they do sort of go the way of the dodo. I think what we are actually seeing is this section of the gaming community is about to be pushed out. I think that's why their so angry. It's literally like taking a toy away from a child. If you actually take a toy away from a child, they just completely freak out. This is exactly what is happening, I think.</blockquote>


Dan Person, GamesIndustry.biz:


<blockquote>There's an awful lot of psychology and studies into this idea of the online personality; This idea of the power of anonymity, and the keyboard warrior and what that kind of does to people when you take away the consequences of actions in that way. That's still a relatively new area of study. The Internet is certainly, in human terms, a very recent invention.

I think when you get unfettered and unregulated communities of young, let's face it, mostly men who are operating in this way without any kind of adult or intelligent supervision, they can become very quickly violent and vile and unpleasant. That echo chamber can accentuate that effect. And then when somebody comes into the playroom and says, "hey guys. You know you should stop doing that and perhaps behave like adults," there is often that phase of tantrum, basically. And if those children happen to be handling a large blunt object, then that can become dangerous.</blockquote>


Keza McDonald, Kotaku UK:


<blockquote>The Internet gamifies people. It turns you into someone who's not a real person. You're some imaginary thing on the end of a Twitter handle. It makes it easier for people to behave inhumanly towards you. Anyone who basically decides to do cultural criticism of games that goes beyond just the assessment of software will probably come up against people who ask them, "why can't you just talk about the game?" Again, for these people, games are systems that are self-contained and for them the community and the world of gaming is also a system that is self-contained. So as soon as you start trying to place it in a real world context or you start talking about it in a way that they're not used to, I think that it really confuses people and upsets them.</blockquote>
