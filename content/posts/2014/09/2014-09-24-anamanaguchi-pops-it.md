Today [Anamanaguchi released their new single "Pop It."](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/pop-it-ep/id919777258) It's a bit of a departure from chip-tune pop-punk but I can't argue with the hooks. This band is too good. Really wish I had enrolled in the [School of Chip-Tune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamhax/anamanaguchi-make-endless-fantasy-more-than-album).

**UPDATE**: "Pop It" is now featured in [this Target commercial](http://youtube.com/watch?v=v1AYDW4swqQ). That is huge.
