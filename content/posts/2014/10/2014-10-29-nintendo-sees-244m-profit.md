[Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2014/141029e.pdf):


<blockquote>With respect to “Wii U,” Nintendo released “Mario Kart 8” globally in May, which has continued to show steady sales, as well as “Hyrule Warriors,” released in September in the overseas markets, which has gained popularity. The worldwide sales of the “Wii U” hardware and software were 1.12 million units and 9.4 million units respectively.

Since the May release of “Mario Kart 8,” the “Wii U” platform has been experiencing improved sales momentum.</blockquote>


_Mario Kart 8_ remains far and away my go-to Wii U game. I love it. My fianceé loves it. I frequently listen to the soundtrack at work. (Some choice words [here](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/04/grant-kirkhope-releases-banjo-kazooie-ost-on-bandcamp/).) When I can't sleep, it's enjoyed with a nightcap. Not to mention that it's challenging. Five months after release, I'm still chipping away 100cc stars.

<blockquote>Nintendo gambled for positive reviews two weeks before launch, is now chalking up at least $40 in games to every US and Canadian Mario Kart owning household, and prays that their Trojan horse will be the spark to move units. Since release, the game has received stunning accolades, Club Nintendo has been brought down by what can only be assumed as immense traffic for free games, and at least one Wii U newcomer is being tugged at by curiosity.</blockquote>
