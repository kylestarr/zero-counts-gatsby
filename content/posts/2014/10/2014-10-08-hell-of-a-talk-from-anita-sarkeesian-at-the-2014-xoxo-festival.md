[Anita Sarkeesian, XOXO Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8mhDW6Shs):


<blockquote>For these detractors, it is easier to believe that I'm a skin-bleaching, mind-controlling, video-game-hating, scam artist involved in a masterful long-con than it is to believe that the tide is turning in gaming. That larger numbers of developers and fans are challenging the sexist status-quo and embracing the ideas and critiques expressed in my work and the work of many other women doing the same cultural criticism.</blockquote>


That about sums up #gamergate. We are extremelyÂ fortunate to brave folks like Sarkeesian facing this head-on.
