[Kyle Hilliard, GameInformer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/10/04/banjo-kazooie-composer-posts-entire-soundtrack-online-for-download.aspx?utm_content=bufferf5d8a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer):


<blockquote>Grant Kirkhope, composer for Rare who created the Banjo-Kazooie soundtrack along with many others, has posted the soundtrack in its entirety online for download.

When we say the entire soundtrack, we mean everything. Among the 164 tracks, you will find familiar tunes, but you will also find the small musical cues and fanfares related to things like opening doors and collecting certain objects.</blockquote>


I've been streaming the [_Super Mario 64_ OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVUipXiqOc) from YouTube at work a lot lately. (Yes, YouTube.) I understand Nintendo has a sales strategy in place for their OSTs (see [_Super Smash Bros. 3DS_ Sleep Mode OST](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/24/6063069/super-smash-bros-play-in-sleep-mode-lets-you-listen-to-the-soundtrack)), but come on. Want the Super Smash Bros. OST? [Here's the deal](http://club2.nintendo.com/smash-promo/) (emphasis mine):


<blockquote>Buy and register _both_ the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS _and_ Super Smash Bros. for Wii U games to receive a special soundtrack from Club Nintendo!</blockquote>


I'm not sure how Kirkhope is able to release this content, but he's got my money. (And I've got a great Nintendo 64 era OST in ALAC.) Download [here](https://grantkirkhope.bandcamp.com/album/banjo-kazooie-everything-and-the-kitchen-sink).

Someone call Koji Kondo and tell him we are ready for his box set.
