<blockquote>Not since Encyclopedia Britannica’s heyday have volumes of books looked this cool and demanded to be on your bookshelf. With The Elder Scrolls Online, two volumes covering “The Land” and “The Lore” feature never-before-seen art and extensive lore surrounding the game. Meanwhile, by popular demand, the Skyrim series offers the first opportunity to get all of the game’s in-game text across three volumes.</blockquote>


I always thought it would be great to read written versions of heavy-narrative games. Even with multiple "choose-your-own-adventure" storylines, the writers could choose a plot line to get the point across.

There are plenty of game universes I want to explore (_Elder Scrolls_, _Mass Effect_, and _World of Warcraft_ to name a few), but don't have 60+ hours to spare on side-quests, menu navigation, and controller mechanics. Don't even get me started on the time dolled out to obsessive character creation.

While these _Elder Scrolls_ "lore" books may not be my ideal solution, they are certainly a better intro to the universes than spin-off, expanded, and/or non-canon storylines.
