[Host of the DLC podcast Jeff Cannata to co-host Christian Spicer regarding the Driveclub launch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/44-rub-supermans-shoulders/id794234509?i=320036889&mt=2):


<blockquote>I think you brought up a really interesting point in saying, "we should be able to return these games." The idea that this industry as a whole has figured out a way to convince the public that they can't return broken products, that you buy it and you're screwed, that there's no lemon law for software, is a little bit ridiculous.</blockquote>


After hearing this, I was immediately reminded ofÂ why I continue to base my video game purchases on reviews. If a return policy and/or less expensive price-tag was put in place, would I be willing to take more chances? I'm not entirely sure. But as it stands, I am not willing to take, as DLC guest Brian Brushwood put it, "a $60 gamble."
