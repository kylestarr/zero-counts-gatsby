[Dialog between Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Midnight in Paris](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/midnight-in-paris/id485597050):


<blockquote>GP: Would you read it?

EH: Your novel?

GP: Yeah, it's about 400 pages long, and I'm just looking for an opinion.

EH: My opinion is I hate it.

GP: Well you haven't even read it yet.

EH: If it's bad, I'll hate it because I hate bad writing, and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer.</blockquote>


If you're not sold on this exchange, [I'll do you one better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6n34E2vXzs). A beautiful film. Made for nostalgists like myself.
