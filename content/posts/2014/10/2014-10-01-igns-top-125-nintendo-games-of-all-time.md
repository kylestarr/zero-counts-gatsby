To round out their 125th Nintendo Anniversary celebration, Nintendo has released their [the same Let's Plays](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/08/28/ign-celebrates-nintendos-125th-anniversary-by-playing-125-nintendo-games/) I've been thoroughly enjoying for over a month).

[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/the-top-125-nintendo-games-of-all-time):


<blockquote>Nintendo merely publishing a game that was developed by a third party does _not _make it eligible - for a game to be considered a "Nintendo game" in our eyes, Nintendo has to have had a hand in the development process itself. This excludes games like Golden Sun (developed by Camelot and published by Nintendo) and Meteos (developed by Q Entertainment and published by Nintendo).</blockquote>


The lack of third-party games published by Nintendo never crossed my mind. A truly impressive catalog from a truly revolutionary company. Again, [a story I can believe in](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/09/30/stats-v-story/).
