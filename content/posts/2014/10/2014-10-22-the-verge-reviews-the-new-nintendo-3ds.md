[Sam Byford, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/21/7025667/new-nintendo-3ds-review):


<blockquote>The 3DS is worth owning for the [same reason the Wii U is](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/27/6073421/why-you-should-buy-a-nintendo-wii-u): its software library is spearheaded by Nintendo, one of the most consistent and talented developers in the world. There’s no doubt that smartphones have taken a big chunk out of the DS’ user base, but all that proves is that a whole lot of people bought a DS because it was first to what we would now call smartphone-style games. In 2014, [many smartphone games are fantastic](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/14/6974135/best-iphone-games); very few of the fantastic ones are traditional video games. And if you like traditional video games, you should absolutely own a 3DS.</blockquote>


I love my Wii U. Really looking forward to owning a New Nintendo 3DS.
