[Deadline](http://deadline.com/2014/10/myst-tv-series-legendary-cyan-worlds-847110/):



<blockquote>“Cyan’s goal in working with Legendary is not just to create a compelling TV drama but to develop a true transmedia product that will include a companion video game that extends the story across both media,” the company said. “Seventy percent of tablet owners use their device while watching TV at least several times a week. Cyan sees the potential to push the boundaries of interactive storytelling to a new level.”

Seems like good timing with the return of [Twin Peaks](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/showbiz/tv/twin-peaks-returns-showtime/index.html) and the nostalgia surrounding the [LOST 10 year anniversary](http://ign.com/articles/2014/03/17/5-things-we-learned-at-the-lost-10-year-reunion).

That said, I don't feel the second-screen experience has been the revolution that hopefuls (HBO, etc.) had cracked it up to be. I have a difficult time pulling myself away from a good story to send an email, text, or surf the web. I have a hard time believe that "70 percent" is enjoying good TV. While a new Myst companion game sounds enticing, I have extreme reservations that I'll be able to enjoy a world as rich and mysterious as Myst simultaneously on TV and iPad. The best I can picture is a children's TV-esque situation where the actors on-screen "wait" for you to complete a puzzle before proceeding.

On the other hand, I love Myst and have very vivid memories of talking through the games with both my step-father at home and father 400 miles away. I enjoyed the game so much that I convinced my grade-school teacher to allow me to write a book report based in the strategy guide. Needless to say, I'll be tuning in.
