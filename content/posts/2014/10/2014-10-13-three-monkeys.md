[Jordan Erica Webber, The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/13/video-games-that-let-blind-people-play):



<blockquote>In that demo, a sprite called Yoska teaches the player how to use their hearing to hunt a bird and shoot it down with a bow and arrow and fight bandits and goblins with a sword. It sounds like something you’d expect to do in a modern big-budget RPG, which Willey says is intentional: “What we’re really aiming for is an audio game that has a kind of AAA [those with the highest development budgets and levels of promotion] feel about it.”

That should appeal to vision-impaired players such as Harlow, whose experience of “real video games” before he lost his sight has led him to consider many audio games “kind of bad, and just not entertaining”. But Willey and Satizabal both hope sighted players will enjoy the game too, so that they can have a shared experience with those who are vision-impaired.</blockquote>



Sounds extremely interesting and like a great focus for game development. Start any piece with the words _Super Mario 64_ and you'll have my attention.
