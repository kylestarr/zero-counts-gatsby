[T.C. Sottek writing for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/15/6983833/stop-gamergate-gains-momentum):


<blockquote>Still, it's important for reasonable people to speak up, if only to set the terms of reality — something Gamergate's most hardcore supporters don't even seem to grasp. Gamergate's echo chamber is an endless rabbit hole of paranoia, like an irredeemably dark version of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland._ The entire affair is built on trolling, counter-trolling, anger, and ignorance; Gamergate's forums exhibit deranged skepticism in almost everything, including vicious doubts about every woman who speaks up against harassment and threats. Entire threads have been devoted to accusing Sarkeesian and other recipients of hatred and violence of running false-flag campaigns to elevate their own status. In their world, everyone who's not on their side is a "shill" who's lying for attention.</blockquote>


Not long ago, I was celebrating the social brilliance of _[Twitch Plays Pokémon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/19/5426204/what-the-hell-is-twitch-plays-pokemon);_ a weeks-long, virtual slog with an estimated [658,000 participants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pokémon#Viewership) that, looking back, actually had tremendous potential for mass frustration, intimidation, and organized harassment. Instead, the community-at-large generated spontaneous and fascinating politics, factions, deities, usurpers, and home-brewed mythology that eventually panned in favor of progress and the completion of the game.

Needless to say, I am completely floored by the idiocy and insanity of Gamergate.
