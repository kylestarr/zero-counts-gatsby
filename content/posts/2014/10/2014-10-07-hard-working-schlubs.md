[Jeremy Parish writing on his 2-dimensions.com blog](http://2-dimensions.com/2014/10/06/by-request-how-my-time-in-the-gaming-press-has-changed-my-perspective/):


<blockquote>Video games are made by hard-working schlubs, and they’re written about by hard-working schlubs, and both categories of schlub do so in service of the hard-working schlubs who do their schlubbing so they can afford to buy video games. We’re not so different, you and I.</blockquote>


Great perspective piece on 10+ years working in the gaming press. I have Parish, in part, to thank for where I am today. From one hard-working schlub, schlubbing to afford to write about video games on the side (because I can't help it either), to another hard-working schlub: Thank you.
