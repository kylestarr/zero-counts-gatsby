[Dialog between Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) and Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt), Chef](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/chef/id877741061):


<blockquote>CC: What exactly are you doing here?

RM: I'm eating the food. I'm eating your food.

CC: I thought my food was needy and cloying.

RM: Well, I didn't think you'd want to serve me, so I sent somebody else to pick it up.

CC: What happened between us, that really knocked me for a loop. I mean, you robbed me of my pride and my career and my dignity. And I know people like you don't usually care about that kind of thing...

RM: That's not necessarily true.

CC: But you should know it hurts people like me. 'Cause we're really trying.

RM: You started a flame war with me. Are you kidding me? I buy ink by the barrel, buddy. What are you doing picking a fight with me? I wouldn't challenge you to a cook off.

CC: I thought I was sending you a private message.

RM: I didn't know that. I thought we were having fun. It was theater. By the way, what the fuck were you cooking? You totally shat the bed, buddy. How could I back that? You were one of my early boys.

CC: I had no control over the menu.

RM: Whatever the case, okay? You seem to be cooking for yourself again. Because this shit is sensational. I mean, really, really good.

CC: Thank you.</blockquote>


I really enjoyed this movie. Very simple and to the point. Good food is great, my opinion on critics (including myself) is iffy at best, and Twitter can be terrible. In a world of limited text, context counts. Inspiring, real stuff. Well done, Favreau.
