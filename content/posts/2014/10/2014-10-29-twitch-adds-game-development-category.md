<blockquote>[The Game Development category](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Game%20Development) was launched on Oct. 16 and works exactly the same way as a category for a specific game on Twitch. But in this case you're tuning in to watch people develop games live, rather than watch someone playing a released title.

"We conducted a Twitch Town Hall session at PAX Prime which is when we let our community share ideas they would like to see implemented on the platform," said Marcus "djWHEAT" Graham, Twitch's director of community  and education. "The idea of having a section for game developers was suggested and it resonated with the audience, so that inspired us to add it as a category."</blockquote>


Twitch has yet to hook me, but this might do the trick.
