[Leigh Alexander, writing for Time](http://time.com/3274247/video-game-culture-war/):

> As video games unshackle from old constraints, traditional fans double down on keeping the treehouse sacrosanct. The tension between “games as product” and “games as culture” is visible within these online controversies as everyone invested in the industry watches to see which will “win”. Someone should tell the internet conspiracy theorists they can relax — we’ll absolutely, definitely have both.

One of Alexander's many terrific pieces. Another great bit at [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/10/02/gamers-over). (via [Peter Hollo](https://twitter.com/frogworth))
