Speaking of reviews, here's a interesting follow-up from the side of developers.

[Brian P. Shea, IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/14/the-rating-game-how-reviews-impact-those-who-create):


<blockquote>Ultimately, reviews should never be viewed as the final word on a game. Instead, they're guidelines for readers to apply to their own personal taste. If a review gives a game a 7.0 and cites poor multiplayer a one of the game's issues, but you don't intend on playing the multiplayer, you can synthesize that review and conclude that you might be very likely to enjoy the game more than the critic - and that's OK.</blockquote>


A worthwhile read but I maintain that a 7.0 persists asÂ a flag. It is likely going to deter consumers from [a $60 gamble](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/14/a-60-gamble/) "to apply their own personal taste."
