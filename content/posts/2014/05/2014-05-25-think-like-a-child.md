[Economist Steven Levitt, Freakonomics Radio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519?mt=2&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG):


<blockquote>Video games are fun. My son, Nick, who's 11-years-old, could play video games for eight hours straight. Could Nick work at a job, say at McDonald's, for eight hours? No. So it seems to me, what you take away from that is if you could make a job as fun as a video game, then you'd have all of the 11-year-old boys in the world, and probably the 15-year-old and 20-year-old and maybe even the 30-year-old boys lining up at your door trying to take that job.</blockquote>


This sentiment is very much echoed in game designer Jane McGonigal's book [Reality is Broken](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/reality-is-broken/id409506505?mt=11&uo=4&at=1l3v2y3&ct=TSOG). A worthwhile read on the fulfilling benefits of games and updating the today's workplace / social constructs to be more game-like.

Levitt continues:


<blockquote>I think fun is so much more important than people realize and I've seen it in academics. When I interview young professors and try to decide if we should hire them, I've evolved over time to one basic rule: If I think they love economics and it's fun for them, then I'm in favor of hiring them. No matter how talented they seem otherwise, if it seems like a job or effort or work, then I don't want to hire them.</blockquote>


In March of 2013, I wrote about the idea of [circling back to childhood hobbies](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/identity-crisis-kids-know-best/) when I am feeling lost. Many of those hobbies I am still fond of today. They act as fantastic through-lines that keep me on track when I feel I have strayed too far off course or have lost sight of my path. See also [Finding Your Calling](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/05/24/finding-your-calling-part-i-what-is-a-vocation/) published on The Art of Manliness on the idea of pursuing _vocation_ rather than a job or career.
