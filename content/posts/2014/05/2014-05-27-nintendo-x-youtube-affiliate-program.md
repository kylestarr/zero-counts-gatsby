[Mike Futter, Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/05/27/report-nintendo-to-begin-youtube-affiliate-program):



<blockquote>Nintendo is taking a step in the right direction here, but it is far from the open policy taken by publishers of all sizes, including Devolver Digital, Deep Silver, and Ubisoft. Based on what little we understand right now, it appears that YouTube creators will need to be part of the affiliate program in order to monetize. This would give Nintendo some control over content, and it could choose to remove those creators it later disapproves of for whatever reason.</blockquote>



I see others following suit.
