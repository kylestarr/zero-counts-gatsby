[Harmonix spokesperson to Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/29/5761388/harmonix-layoffs-new-ceo-chief-creative-officer):


<blockquote>Harmonix is in the process of restructuring our organization to bring it into alignment with our current and future product development plans. Unfortunately, this means making the difficult decision to reduce the number of full-time staff. We sincerely appreciate the work of each and every one of these employees. Harmonix is working to ensure that those affected are well taken care of as we make this change.</blockquote>


The spokesperson also offered that these layoffs are unrelated to the unbundling the Kinect. My thoughts to those affected.
