[Pramod Sharma, Tangible Play CEO and co-founder, on skills machines can't replicate](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/22/5722054/osmo-tangible-play):


<blockquote>One is the social and emotional learning. How do we connect with people? There's a skill required in that. That's fundamental for anyone. In school, they don't know how to teach those kids.

The second one is creative, out of the box thinking. How do you teach kids to be creative? The theory [from educators] is when you're using a device, or any gaming device, you're creatively always a function of what the device lets you do. The Wii, for example, you can do only a constraint of what the controller is. You cannot go beyond this.</blockquote>


A simple modification turned creative moderator. Fascinating.
