[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/21/5723572/heroes-of-the-storm-making-of-blizzard):


<blockquote>In most games of this genre you earn currency which is used to buy items, potions and buffs that make your character more powerful. Picking the right items at the right time for your character is a huge part of both League of Legends and Dota 2.

They were discussing the idea of removing the item shop altogether, and one of the game's designers was becoming, as Browder put it "emotionally distressed" at the idea of removing an aspect of the game that's a key part of the genre.

There were people on the team against the idea of an item shop and a gold system, as they just allowed those in the lead to remain in the lead and crush the other side. It added a layer of complexity that may not be welcoming to new players.</blockquote>


Worked well for Hearthstone.

I've been dreaming of a cross-over title since the original [Warcraft III teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akzF_rU1Fqg), initially mistaking the rain of the Burning Legion as Zerg.
