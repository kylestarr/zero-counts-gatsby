[Emily Gera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/16/5723064/xbox-one-kinect-rare-phil-spencer):


<blockquote>Xbox head Phil Spencer confirms Microsoft is working closely with U.K. developer Rare to evaluate the studio's future now that Kinect peripherals are optional for Xbox One systems, OXM reports.

Despite the studio's history developing GoldenEye 007 and Donkey Kong Country, Rare was retooled as a flagship Kinect studio, releasing its first Kinect project Kinect Sports in 2010. Rare continued with this franchise, releasing Kinect Sports: Season Two and Kinect Sports Rivals.</blockquote>


In May of 2013, following the news that [Microsoft will be breathing new life into a ‘historic’ Rare franchise](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/21/rare-to-show-historic-franchise-on-xbox-one-at-e3) (turned out to be Killer Instinct), I wrote a piece about Microsoft’s need to invest in child-friendly colorful characters and how Rare could pull it off:

[Xbox One: Swinging for the Franchise Fences with Rare IP?](http://thestarrlist.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-swinging-for-the-franchise-fences-with-rare-ip/)

Seeing as the price-drop will likely draw more appeal from parents, Microsoft should invest in the children’s market with Rare IP to set itself apart from PS4 and, dare I say it, Wii U.
