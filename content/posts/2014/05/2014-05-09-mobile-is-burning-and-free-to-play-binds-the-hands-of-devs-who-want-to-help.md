[Mobile is burning, and free-to-play binds the hands of devs who want to help](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/9/5699058/free-to-play-mobile-candy-crush-the-room)


Barry Meade of Fireproof Games writing for Polygon:





<blockquote>In 2013 mobile games made over $10 billion globally and allegedly this is great. $10 billion sounds a lot, it is a lot, but the makers of _Candy Crush_ alone took almost $2 billion. Throw in the top ten and there's most of your games market gone; hoovered up by ten cute grinding games that are clones of each other. Any remaining change from that money is scraped off the table and scattered across a games industry trying to service a billion devices.

A 2 percent "engaged’ audience does not seem towering in achievement for a creative industry that looks to draw its players into new experiences. We're living in a world where Netflix's content inspires hysteria in grown adults, so is mobile gaming really in the same league when 98 percent of its gamers spend more on pencil sharpeners than games made by our billion-dollar leaders?</blockquote>




In my experience, _The Room_ sparks the same water-cooler conversations for non-gamers that _Myst_ did. It appears [_Monument Valley_](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/monument-valley-a-review/) is doing the same, as experienced with my non-gaming colleagues. I think "the binge" has hindered the TV water-cooler conversation now that everyone is on their own schedule. Delivery of challenging and original yet "polished" and "possible" experiences can bring back the general audience gaming conversations we had on the playground.
