[Glenn Beck on Watch Dogs as quoted by Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/30/5763922/glenn-beck-watch-dogs-hack-ubisoft):


<blockquote>This game is teaching you to hack into whatever is docked in your bedroom. What the heck is wrong with us? What are we thinking? We are inviting this into our home and our lives. We are teaching our kids for entertainment purposes.</blockquote>
