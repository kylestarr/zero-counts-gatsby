[Ryan Reed, Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-simpsons-reveal-new-slacker-character-through-app-game-20140530):


<blockquote>Dupree, who rocks a purple beanie and heaphones, isn't a complete newcomer to the _Simpsons _universe (having been mentioned verbally in the 2012 episode "Gone Abie Gone"), but he hasn't yet appeared on the series. Previously, the app debuted another new character, Kumiko Nakamura, for a limited run before she appeared as the Comic Book Guy's romantic interest in the Season 25 episode "Married to the Blob." The snarky, comical app often features tie-ins to the series, allowing players to acquire items connected to upcoming episodes.</blockquote>
