<blockquote>Integrating new technology into our daily lives relies upon accessibility, affordability and ease of use. Where motion control is concerned, video games are the perfect Trojan horse.</blockquote>


A great piece on the health benefits of motion control.

I've failed to look at video game motion controls as a power player in the physical therapy industry. I don't doubt that motion controls will fade away from the consumer video game market. However, it is worth noting that these tools do exist and have been invested in while, at the same time, lifestyle betterment (health, environment, social, etc.) has become a huge focus in the tech landscape. I don't think this is the end of Kinect.
