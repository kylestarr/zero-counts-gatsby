[Susan Senator, writing for Cognoscenti, on "Webster Goomez" the stuffed Goomba](http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2014/05/23/the-sometimes-surprising-effects-of-video-games):


<blockquote>A day or so later, Ben remarked that Webster was 'kind of adorable.'

Adorable? Did I hear that right? Never had such a word come out of Ben before. I quickly recovered my cool and tried not to make too big a deal out of it, so as not to embarrass him. But inside, I cradled that word, longed to hear it again, hoping I hadnâ€™t imagined it. But no, this was for real. A few days later, I heard Ben describing a different character as 'cute.'</blockquote>



Cute :)
