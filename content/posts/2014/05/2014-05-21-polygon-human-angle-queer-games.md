[Mattie Brice, developer of Mainichi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQB5snyJfXk):


<blockquote>If I was to watch [Mainichi] be played anywhere it would be upsetting. Maybe upsetting is a good thing. I think we should be upset by games. I think that's a valid emotion to happen. It's not meant for me to feel good. It does make other people feel good because in a sense, this game has been validating. Many people are like, "Oh! I've had that experience too. I'm not alone."</blockquote>


[Human Angle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT4g6hX3DEbKLBD-JO5Qyz0O) is such a beautiful series.
