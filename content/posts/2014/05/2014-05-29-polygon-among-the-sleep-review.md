[Philip Kollar, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/29/5745584/among-the-sleep-review):


<blockquote>I have a nine-month-old child myself, and when he wakes up in the middle of the night sobbing and shaken, I cannot help but wonder what it is that could be torturing the dreams of someone so young. Among the Sleep posits an answer by letting players journey through its two-year-old protagonist's darkest nightmares.</blockquote>


Between Gone Home and Among the Sleep, the first-person narrative is crawling into innovative territory.
