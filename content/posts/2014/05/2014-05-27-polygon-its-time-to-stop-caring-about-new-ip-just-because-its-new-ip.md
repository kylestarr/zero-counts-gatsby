[Ben Kuchera](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/27/5754388/watch-dogs-wolfenstein-new-ip-die-hard):


<blockquote>I’m not saying that we shouldn’t celebrate new ideas in games, I’m saying that new franchises and game titles aren’t any more or less likely to deliver them than games in an existing series.</blockquote>


Bingo, Ben.

I'm not sure the last time I cared about new IP. Frankly, I'm more excited to hear how Nintendo will reinvent Mario again.
