[Jessica Valenti of The Guardian on #YesAllWomen](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/yesallwomen-barage-sexism-elliot-rodger?CMP=ema_565):


<blockquote>Part of the obstinate disbelief seems to be a need to protect the privileges of sexism: associating misogyny with a mass murder would mean having to recognize just how dangerous misogyny really is and - if you're partaking - giving it up. Some men want to believe that they can continue to call women "sluts" and make rape jokes without being part of a broader cultural impact. But they can't: sexism, from everyday harassment to inequality enshrined in policy, pollutes our society as a whole and limits our ability to create real justice for women.</blockquote>



Jessica Valenti doing magnificent work at The Guardian. A must read for all, especially those partaking in communities largely supported by anonymity.
