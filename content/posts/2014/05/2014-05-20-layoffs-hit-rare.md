[Wesley Yin-Poole, Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-19-layoffs-hit-rare-following-kinect-sports-rivals-flop):


<blockquote>While Microsoft did not confirm how many people had been let go, Eurogamer understands the number is around 16, a figure one source said was made up of some software staff, but mainly design and project managers. Kinect Sports Rivals was a 150 person project.</blockquote>


A Microsoft spokesperson issued Eurogamer the following statement:


<blockquote>At Xbox, our goal is to constantly create new fun, social and interactive entertainment experiences. As part of Rare's commitment to this goal, we have made a decision to change our development process and methodology at Rare to best support our future projects, this has led to us reviewing the skills and the makeup of our development teams in our business.

Rare continues to invest in our people and future projects.</blockquote>


This news comes on the heels of [Rare re-evaluating their direction](https://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/rare-is-evaluating-what-to-do-after-kinect-says-phil-spencer-polygon/) after Microsoft's decision to offer Kinect-less Xbox One units. My thoughts to those let go. [Layoffs list](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/save-developers-and-you-will-save-your-soul/) updated.
