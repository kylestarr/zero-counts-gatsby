[Comments from Darrell Rodriguez, CEO of Trendy Entertainment, as they appear on GamesIndustry International](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-05-21-dungeon-defenders-studio-lays-off-20-percent):


<blockquote>Currently, we are not profitable, but we have products in the pipeline to get us there. We are in between launches, so our cash flow is a concern. We are taking the necessary steps to fix this to ensure Dungeon Defenders II gets out the door at the great quality people have come to expect. We're at a critical time where execution and performance is essential to our ongoing success.

...

We are doing this very unpleasant action with respect, empathy and compassion in consideration of the great work that these people have contributed to Trendy.

...

As discussed last time, a lot of the culture had already shifted upon my arrival. I'm working closely with devs and leads to create more openness and better communication at all levels of the company. Cultural change does not happen overnight, but we have ongoing efforts to work on better cross-departmental communication, getting the leads directly involved in product planning and holding consistent company wide meetings to ensure we are all on the same page. There's a long way to go, but we're on our way</blockquote>


Rodriguez's statements on culture change are well met. Healthy company culture is key and appears to be a hot topic in light of the layoff crisis plaguing development studios as of late. My thoughts to those affected. [Layoff list](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/save-developers-and-you-will-save-your-soul/) updated.
