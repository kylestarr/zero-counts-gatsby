[Jagger Gravning, Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/articles/feature/how-major-videogames-are-slowly-readying-us-gay-protagonist/):


<blockquote>While there is no modern Hays Code equivalent in contemporary American video games (the ESRB rates but does not censor) the manner that LGBT characters are being introduced to a broader audience in major games is through this same blowback-wary method of diligent self-policing. The writers allow space for an audience member to overlook or deny the homosexuality of a particular character if that’s the way they would prefer to see things.

Game writers like Rhianna Pratchett, who has stated that part of her would have [loved Lara Croft to be gay](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/interviews/tomb-raider-writer-rhianna-pratchett-why-every-kill-cant-be-first-and-why-she-wanted-make-lara-croft-gay/), are instead artfully presenting these characters in a manner that is more aesthetically palatable to players (and likely their concerned parents) who might find explicit same-sex love too lurid or off-putting a subject to handle with frankness in a video game.</blockquote>


Gravning continues:


<blockquote>For many years, if a film did focus on a black character, the story would generally be about that character’s experience being black, like _The Jackie Robinson Story_ or _Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner_ and many blacksploitation films. It took time for producers, and perhaps audiences, to realize there could be stories involving non-white characters that didn’t have to revolve around their ethnicity.</blockquote>


I wish I had read this prior to [Harper's post](http://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/braving-blizzard-and-inclusion-in-games/). A brilliant contextualization of today's human rights issues displayed on a canvas of modern media; ethnic tip-toeing in early 20th century filmmaking vs. LGBT tip-toeing in early 21st century video game making.
