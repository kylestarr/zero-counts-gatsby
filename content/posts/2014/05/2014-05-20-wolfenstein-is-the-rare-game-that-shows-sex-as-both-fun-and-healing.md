[Ben Kuchera, Polygon:](http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/20/5734482/wolfenstein-sex)


<blockquote>Sex in games is almost exclusively used to give players, who are assumed to be male, something to ogle at between blood baths. The last place I expected a more realistic, and often touching, view of sex was the latest Wolfenstein game.</blockquote>
