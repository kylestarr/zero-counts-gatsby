> **Brendon Bigley**: I just want more portrait mode games on my iPhone.
> 
> **Stephen Hilger**: Yeah, that's the dream.
> 
> **BB**: That's the dream. That's what we're always saying on this podcast. The whole reason we started the podcast.
> 
> Hello and welcome to Into the Aether.
> 
> **SH**: Jean d'Arc definitive edition in portrait mode.
> 
> **BB**: Honestly, it's amazing. Just thinking about that, it's amazing that all of the *Dragon Quest* games are available in portrait mode on iOS.
> 
> **SH**: That's for you.
> 
> **BB**: And it's so wild that they did that. Yeah, even VII. Like they have a port.
> 
> It's so wild.
