[Lewis Gordon writing for this gorgeous article on The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/20/arts/metroidvania-games-metroid-castlevania.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) (Note: This article is walled off.

> The two Metroidvania progenitors — 1986’s Metroid and 1987’s Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest — cultivated a sense of geographical bewilderment by letting players unfurl the secrets of their arcane worlds in any direction along the X and Y axes. Part of the charm is that the entirety of these expansive play spaces is not immediately accessible: Sections lie gated behind power-ups, like the so-called Morph Ball and High Jump Boots in Metroid, and players are forced to rely on a labyrinthine map.

> The genre has come to be known for its friction, with a propensity for baffling mazelike settings, acute sense of isolation and often punishing combat. Yet Jeremy Parish, a journalist who helped popularize the term Metroidvania and wrote an upcoming book on the genre, said that in some ways they are more accessible role-playing games that do not get bogged down in stats and menus. Characters grow while exploring a vast world, allowing Metroidvanias to deliver immersion, exploration and a sense of discovery.

Metroidvanias (referred to as “search-action games” in Japan, as listeners of The Besties will recognize) are some of my favorite games. A few years ago, in anticipation for *Metroid Dread*, I played through the five core 2D Metroid games:

- *Metroid: Zero Mission* (GBA)
- *Metroid: Samus Returns* (3DS)
- *Super Metroid* (SNES (via 3DS))
- *Metroid Fusion* (GBA)
- *Metroid Dread* (Switch)

Before that, I’d played through and loved *Ori and the Blind Forest* and *Ori and the Will of the Wisps*.

To Parish’s point, immersion and discovery are my favorite parts of Metroidvanias. But I’ve learned that locomotion is critical to making them feel great. Ori and Zero Mission: Bingo. Super Metroid: Not so much.

It’s a wonderful genre that continues to innovate, seemingly at all odds with its narrow corridors and repetitive core-loop. How cool that The New York Times gave the genre this beautiful treatment.

(I prefer Into the Aether’s term “Gate-Punk” for this genre.)
