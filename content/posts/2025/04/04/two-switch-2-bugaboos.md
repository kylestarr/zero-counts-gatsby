The internet is awash with Nintendo Switch 2 takes, from hands-on impressions to business analysis to [uncovering the things unsaid by Nintendo](https://wavelengths.online/posts/what-nintendo-didnt-tell-us). I don’t have much to add — I think it looks fine, the price kind of sucks, I’ll probably get one ASAP because I just can’t help myself with a new Nintendo console — but I wanted to document a handful of “bugaboos” about the Switch 2. ([I posted these to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kylestarr.bsky.social/post/3llv45m6v4c2z), but this blog will live in posterity.)

## 1. No OLED

Upgrading from the original Switch to the Switch OLED felt like a revelation. The inky blacks, brilliant hues, and increased brightness made the device feel premium. Jumping from a 6.2-inch screen to a 7.0-inch screen was much more comfortable. *Hades* is a standout. *Metroid Dread* is gorgeous. All older games almost feel new again. “Seeing” a transition to and from a loading screen go completely black in my already very dark room feels oddly magical. Yes, I am a sucker for OLED.

I was very disappointed to learn that Switch 2 has reverted back to an LED screen (with HDR). Nintendo even neglected to show a Switch OLED during the Switch 2 presentation, likely to create the optics that the Switch 2’s 7.9-inch display is notably larger than the original Switch’s 6.2-inch screen (as opposed to the Switch OLED’s 7.0-inch screen).

In my heart of hearts, I know this won’t really affect my enjoyment of the console, but I know I’ll be bothered by it, knowing Nintendo will likely release an OLED version mid-cycle with a smaller bezel (thus larger screen) and an even more beautiful picture. While next-gen does not equal “premium”, the downgrade feels like a missed opportunity to meet the premium market where it is as a standout device.

Understanding the cost of Switch 2 is $450 US (sans tariffs), perhaps the decision to sacrifice an OLED screen was one that had to be made to counter an even more shocking price tag. And offering a “premium” version alongside a standard version would undercut a mid-cycle refresh and perhaps create additional insult to the injury of the already high price.

The snob in me is not excited to see a big gray box between load-ins.

## 2. No Built-in Camera

This is at once easy to ignore and completely shocking. Nintendo spent a fair amount of time focused on the Switch 2’s GameChat social feature, including their first-party camera that can be used in docked mode to stream your face and/or create in-game avatars.

I repeat: Docked. Mode.

After the first six months of the original Switch’s launch in 2017, [Nintendo stated that only 20% of users play primarily in TV (Docked) Mode](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/10/nintendo_gamers_prefer_using_switch_as_a_handheld_rather_than_docked). 30% primarily in Tabletop/Handheld Mode; 50% in both Docked and Handheld Mode.

I’m extremely curious how these numbers have changed after eight years of a gangbusters run, including the Switch Lite (2019) that cannot be docked. But I’m sure primarily Docked Mode has not become any more favorable. So, it’s curious that the camera feature of GameChat is only available via the Dock.

In an effort to declutter our house, I’ve mounted my Switch dock behind my TV. I’m certainly not going to be sticking a camera out from the side it. Without that, I have no way to share my killer facial reactions when I destroy friends in *Mario Kart World* on Switch 2.

GameChat seems to be a feature Nintendo is hanging its hat on for Switch 2 — one that even gets its own dedicated “C” button. Wouldn’t a built-in camera for Handheld mode make sense? Unlike an OLED screen, this seems like a hardware feature that wouldn’t break the bank. The Wii U Gamepad had a camera. The DSi and 3DS had cameras. Even the Game Boy had a camera! (Yeah, yeah…) This just seems like a very weird miss for a feature Nintendo is building its own hardware accessory to support. Maybe the justification is that Handheld users are less likely to have an internet connection and therefore couldn’t use the camera for this purpose. But no internet means no GameChat altogether. And surely a camera could be used for other fun features. Weird!

## Bonus: No Wind Waker HD?!

There’s surely no better way to advertise GameCube games coming to Nintendo Switch Online than with one of the greatest Zelda games of all time, which is exactly what Nintendo did when they announced *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker* as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube library.

However, we’ve now gone a full console cycle without said great Wii U HD port of one of said greatest Zelda games of all time. I shouldn’t be so dramatic about a Wii U port, but a handful of the Switch’s best titles are Wii U ports. Switch launched with Wii U ports *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* (the #1 bestselling Switch game) and *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (yes, [I count it as a port](https://www.polygon.com/zelda/547697/breath-of-the-wild-wii-u))! There’s long been speculation that the *Wind Waker* port — along with the port of *Twilight Princess* — has been in the can and ready for release at any time, likely a “break glass in case of emergency” situation. 

While the release of the original is great for the sake of preservation, it’s a gut-punch for anyone eager to play the acclaimed, refined, and enhanced HD port. Now the chances of the port making it to the Switch 2 feel years away. 

For now, we can try to ignore that something better is likely sitting on a shelf and relive the magic of the original through pillarboxing. (I only want to see 4:3 on my CRT.)
