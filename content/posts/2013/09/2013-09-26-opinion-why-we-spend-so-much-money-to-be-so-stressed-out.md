[Opinion: Why we spend so much money to be so stressed out
](http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/25/4744990/opinion-why-we-spend-so-much-money-to-be-stressed-out)Polygon

A great piece on the arc of human development and stress as depicted by three games:


<blockquote>Like most people who use an alarm clock, I have an unhealthy relationship with stress. It hits me in the chest, disrupts my digestion, and wakes me up at all hours of the night — but it's also the reason I'm going to meet my deadline for this column. Life brings stress, but stress is also a self-inflicted wound, like we're suffering a blow that may never come.

> Not many people would call stress "fun," and yet video games can be stressful. We sometimes willingly pay money to be more stressed. This year gave us a bumper crop of stressful games, and the other day as I was tossing and turning at 5:00 am., I decided to rank them on the inside wall of my cranium. Lucas Pope's recent _[Papers, Please](http://www.polygon.com/game/papers-please/12395)_ made it onto the list, and so did Richard Hofmeier's _[Cart Life](http://www.polygon.com/game/cart-life/8109)_. But I started with Nintendo's [_Pikmin 3_](http://www.polygon.com/game/pikmin-3/8418).
