[China creates Shanghai-based free trade zone, ending game console ban

It will be interesting to see how Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo handle this...


<blockquote>Rumors that the 13-year-old ban would be terminated were confirmed earlier today by China's State Council. The Council published a set of regulations that will govern the "experimental" free trade zone to be set up in Shanghai. The rules put forth by the Council allow foreign companies that run production and sales in the zone to sell game consoles, once the hardware receives approval from China's Ministry of Culture.

China's prohibition on game consoles began in 2000, but despite the ban, sellers have been able to bring game systems to China through Japan and Hong Kong. Online and mobile games have been permitted in the country and have become popular, bringing in high revenue with "freemium" models.
