> "A video game has to have not only an entertainment value, but it also has to teach and be conducive to patriotic education," Arseny Mironov, an aide to Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, who heads the Russian Military History Society, told the Russian newspaper Izvestiya.

Interested to see how this pans out. Propaganda or educational?
