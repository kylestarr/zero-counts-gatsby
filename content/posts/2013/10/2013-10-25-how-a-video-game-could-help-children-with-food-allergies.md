Mmmmmm... educational gaming for health... yum :)


<blockquote>Elizabeth McQuaid, a psychologist at Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center, is overseeing the trial launch of a video game designed to help children with food allergies.

McQuaid teamed up with developer Virtually Better to test a web-based game for children 8-12. Researchers hope the software, which puts players in scenes intended to help them learn more about food allergies, symptoms and reaction management, will reduce the risk of allergic reactions.
