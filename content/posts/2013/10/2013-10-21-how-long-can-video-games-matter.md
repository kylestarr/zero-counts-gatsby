[How Long Can Video Games Matter?
](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/21/how-long-can-video-games-matter)IGN

"A brave and brilliant article" or "Suddenly, I feel empty."


<blockquote>"Furthermore, no game you and I are excited to play right now will continue to sell copies like A Tale of Two Cities. The majority of enjoyable games are disposable. Even the number of _brands_ that could predictably succeed in this capacity is microscopic. Part of this comes from the _brand problem_, which is that every video game sequel seems to be about doing something better rather than having something to say. They don't really add to the art -- they improve on past mistakes. Games are too often too busy chasing the technology ahead of them that there's little room (or budget) left to chase anything else -- design, emotional engagement, or individuality, for instance."
