[GameStop global sales hit $2.11 billion, store sales rise 20.5 percent  
](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/21/5129376/gamestop-q3-2013-financial-report)Polygon

High hopes for video game retailers?

<blockquote>"New software sales for the quarter increased by 43.1, which the company attributed to the "strong performance" of recently-released games — using Rockstar Games' _Grand Theft Auto 5_ as its strongest example example. New hardware sales rose 15.3 percent due to sell-through of the Nintendo 2DS and 3DS handhelds. Conversely, pre-owned sales decreased by two percent." [sic]

Keep in mind that Nintendo does not offer hardware sales directly through digital retailer Amazon.com. This also does not reflect sales of next-fen consoles Xbox One or PS4.
