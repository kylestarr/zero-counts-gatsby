Less TV. More games!


<blockquote>Headed into the study, the authors wanted to study both television and video games, arguing that connections with attention disorders, anger and other problems might be connected to both. Still, researchers wondered if “games may have more powerful effects due to active user engagement, identification with characters and repeated rehearsal and reinforcement.”

**KEY FINDINGS**

****- Exposure to video games had no effect on behavior, attention or emotional issues.

-Watching 3 or more hours of television at age 5 did lead to a small increase in behavioral problems in youngsters between 5 and 7.

- Neither television nor video games lead to attentional or emotional problems.

- There was no difference between boys and girls in the survey results.</blockquote>


In my own experience, [the participatory nature of video games](http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/09/26/the-musical-legacy-of-the-legend-of-zelda#comment-1060376918) adds stress, problem solving, and exploratory functions that can enhance one's imagination. Speaking for myself (and hopefully many others), I feel that this medium has helped flesh-out ones creative passions be it storytelling, pattern assessment, communication, and/or technical know-how. '

As I am currently writing a book, I have found it easiest to open up a world by envisioning how I would explore a video game. I am able to more effectively envision the world through a first or third person view by relying on the mechanics that have been built into some of my favorite video games. The ability to attach myself to video game characters has had a profound impact on my writing abilities. My book may or may not be very good but the ease of writing it has been nurtured by a lifetime of gaming.

How have you benefitted from gaming?
