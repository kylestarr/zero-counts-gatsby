Two study's on the positive size effects of game in one day?!


<blockquote>"...this, the researchers asked 23 adults with an average age of 24 to play _[Super Mario 64](http://www.polygon.com/game/super-mario-64/4113)_ for at least half an hour a day, every day for two months. Compared to a control group of individuals who did not play any games during the study, the gamers evinced "significant gray matter increase" in three areas of the brain: the right hippocampal formation, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral cerebellum."
