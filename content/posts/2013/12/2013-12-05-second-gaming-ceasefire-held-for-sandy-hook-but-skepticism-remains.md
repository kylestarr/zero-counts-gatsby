Shooter "ceasefire" sincerity stimulates sticky situation


<blockquote>The event has also drawn criticism. One of the key issues raised during last year's event was the way in which a "ceasefire" inadvertently created a connection between violent video games and violent actions in the real world. With the media, politicians and various lobbies frequently making that connection on their own, it was seen as fuel for an already problematic image of video games.

According to technology and entertainment writer Daniel Nye Griffiths, whose work has appeared in Forbes and Wired UK, while he doesn't doubt that the ceasefire is coming from a sincere place, such an event is tricky for multiple reasons.
