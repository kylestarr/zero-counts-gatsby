Give8Bit

Make a difference while gaming.


<blockquote>"Over the past couple of years, gamers have raised over 80 million dollars for charities that they care about through games that they love to play. Now this is us just getting started and we can do so much more. So we at Playmob have setup Give8Bit, a channel on Youtube where you can find out the latest campaigns to give as you game. Please subscribe and get involved."
- Jude Ower, Playmob CEO</blockquote>
