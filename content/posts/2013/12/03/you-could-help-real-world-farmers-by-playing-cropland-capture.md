[Dave Tach, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/2/5167386/cropland-capture-help-farmers-geo-wiki):

> _Cropland Capture_, a game hosted on the Geo-Wiki Project's website, tasks players with identifying cropland from Google Earth images. Players get points for identifying land and could win an Amazon Kindle, a Samsung Galaxy S4 and more through the game's ongoing tournament. According to [a recent tweet](https://twitter.com/CropCapture/status/407487594222862336) from the game's official Twitter account, players have combed more than 300,000 square kilometers of land.

Crowd-source gaming initiative to find better cropland.
