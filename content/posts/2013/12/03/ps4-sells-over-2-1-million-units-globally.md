> Speaking about the global 2.1 million figure, House said, "It's an impressive and record-setting accomplishment for our company and for our industry, and we couldn't have done it without you. I want to personally thank PlayStation fans, both old and new, for your vote of confidence.

PS4 sells gangbusters.
