[Bennett Foddy, Playdate game developer, in an interview with Edge Magazine](https://apple.news/IsdvVXTv-QEmpk3HunkMFIQ) (via Apple News+):

> We’ve standardised around two hardware platforms: the touchscreen, and ten buttons, two analog sticks. That’s got its benefits, but you miss out on novel experiences. So yeah, there is something that is kind of punk about it, and that yellow case. It’s like friendly punk.

[I recently restored my Game Boy](/2019/04/21/game-boy-restored/). I don’t play it. It just sits on my desk. But I pick it up every now again because, aside from nostalgia, there’s something so pleasing about it.

As I’ve been thinking about [Playdate](/2019/05/22/playdate/) today, it dawned on me — that something is the [buttons](/2015/05/31/buttons/).
