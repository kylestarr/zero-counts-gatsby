I was invited to write an original piece for the 'From the Aether' newsletter <del>— the bonus newsletter for backers of the [Into the Aether Podcast Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/intothecast/overview).</del>, which, as of December 9, 2019, became available to the public. [I'd love it if you gave it a read on Medium](https://medium.com/@intothecast/from-the-aether-4-f3f330497ea5).

<del>I’ll leave a teaser here, but</del> I encourage you to listen to the podcast. If you’re so inclined, become a patron of an insightful and welcoming [low-key video games podcast](https://anchor.fm/theaether).



<blockquote>The year is 20XX. Video games do not exist. They never have.

And when they come, all of today’s modern technology and tools will be available to their creators. There will have been no precedent other than their analog counterparts, which — come to think of it — consist of cardboard, cards, metal or plastic tokens, dice, tiles, paper, pencils, backpacks, guns, talking… walking… geese…</blockquote>
