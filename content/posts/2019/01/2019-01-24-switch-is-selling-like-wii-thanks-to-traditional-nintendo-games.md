[Chris Kohler, Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/switch-is-selling-like-wii-thanks-to-traditional-ninte-1831998830/):



<blockquote>NPD didn’t release the exact sales number for Smash, but it gave us enough to roughly figure it out. It said that _Ultimate_ exceeded the launch month sales of _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ by over 70 percent. Since that number is known ([2.7 million](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18291)), we can add 70 percent to it to get rough first-month sales for _Ultimate_ at a little over 4.5 million units—again, _not counting_ download sales.

In fact, _Ultimate_’s debut was, NPD said, the best launch month for a console-exclusive game in “video game history.” The strength of the Switch overall also boosted the sales of its major games, sending 2017 games _Mario Kart 8, Breath of the Wild_, and _Super Mario Odyssey_ into 2018's top 20. Overall, NPD said, Nintendo made more money on software than any other publisher this year, a feat it hadn’t achieved since—you guessed it—the salad days of Wii, in 2009.
