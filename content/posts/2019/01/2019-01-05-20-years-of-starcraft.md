[Kosta Andreadis, writing for IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/03/20-years-of-starcraft-an-ign-retrospective):



<blockquote>In the mid-to-late 1990s, the real-time strategy (RTS) genre was not only popular but ubiquitous. RTS games of various styles and settings were everywhere, and a company named Blizzard Entertainment was at the forefront. The studio had become a household name with gamers thanks – primarily – to three titles: 1994’s _Warcraft: Orcs & Humans_, 1995’s _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_ and an action role-playing game released on the final day of 1996 (and developed by Blizzard North), _Diablo_. These games cemented Blizzard as a company that made high quality cinematic story-driven experiences that were fun, accessible, and infinitely repayable.

With _[StarCraft](https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft)_, its third real-time strategy game, Blizzard would leave behind the fantasy world of the breakout Warcraft franchise and set its sights on the distant future. It would take players to a science-fiction setting where humans and strange alien races engaged in isometric high-tech warfare. And the studio would go on a journey of its own; in the time between _Warcraft II_ and _StarCraft_’s launch in 1998 the look and feel of the game would change drastically - alongside its story, characters, vehicles and other player-controlled units. This is the story of that evolution... and the success beyond.

I remember seeing the [original ](https://youtu.be/HnyzZxkxo-c)[_StarCraft_](https://youtu.be/HnyzZxkxo-c)[ trailer](https://youtu.be/HnyzZxkxo-c) for the first time. If memory serves, the trailer was included in the _WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal_ expansion set CD-ROM. At the time, the trailer felt like something out of a Ridley Scott film, only grander. Comedic space goons alarmed and destroyed by a large, brooding, mysterious craft. I was bewildered.

Andreadis has put together a tight, well-written retrospective of _StarCraft_. If you enjoyed the original in the late ‘90s, there are lots of great bits of development insight in here.

The following might be my favorite bit:



<blockquote>Compared to the advances made in digital recording technology available today, to create the sounds and music for _StarCraft_ the team made use of a suite of external synthesizers and outboard hardware, utilising more traditional recording techniques. “Early versions of some of the sounds were pretty cringeworthy,” Glenn admits. “Certain units required more experimentation to get something really unique and special. The first version of the Hydralisk was just plain silly until we figured out how to make them ‘talk’ without words.” This experimentation led to some interesting sources for what many consider to be some of the best sound effects for an RTS of any era.

“Lots of units in the game started with voice as the origin; our voices,” Glenn reveals. “Though most are tweaked beyond recognition. We also used voice for sound effects, such as the Marines’ walkie talkie static. Voice and mouth sounds, like whispers, hisses, and breathing were a big contributor to creating source material to be processed into various strange effects, sweeteners, ambiences and even in the music. One of the chittering Zergling sounds is just me grabbing my cheeks and flapping them open and closed quickly. Processed with pitch and other effects afterwards.”
