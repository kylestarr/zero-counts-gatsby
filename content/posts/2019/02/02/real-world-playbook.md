[Jean Case, early AOL exec, on Recode Decode hosted by Kara Swisher](https://www.recode.net/podcasts/2019/1/30/18203834/jean-case-recode-decode-podcast-interview-be-fearless-book-kara-swisher-aol-america-online):



<blockquote>I see remarkable female founders. I’ve been mentoring one for a long time. She has a startup in New York called [Real World Playbook](https://www.realworldplaybook.com/). She says it’s the Warby Parker for adulthood.

She realizes she’s a privileged person. She went to Princeton. She got a JD MBA from Georgetown. And when she got out of school, she didn’t really know what to do about her taxes. She didn’t know how to pick a healthcare plan. No one had ever really taught her that.

So, she’s got this really great platform that universities all of the United States are embracing and putting their kids through — to teach them how to go into adulthood. I mean, who would thing we’d have to disrupt that industry?</blockquote>



Good idea, but it’s a shame it’s needed. It’s silly that we don’t provide these tools in high school. Add in technology basics (backups, privacy, etc.) and it sounds a lot like [Home Economics 2.0](https://www.zerocounts.net/home-economics-2-0/).
