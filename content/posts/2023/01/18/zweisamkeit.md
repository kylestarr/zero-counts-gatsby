[A passage from "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" by Gabrielle Zevin](https://gabriellezevin.com/tomorrowx3/):

> "'Zweisamkeit' is the feeling of being alone even when you're with other people." Simon turned to look in his husband's eyes. "Before I met you, I felt this constantly. I felt it with my family, my friends, and every boyfriend I ever had. I felt it so often that I thought this was the nature of living. To be alive was to accept that you were fundamentally alone." Simon's eyes were moist. "I know I'm impossible, and I know you don't care about German words or marriage. All I can say is, I love you and thank you for marrying me anyway."

> Ant raised his glass. "Zweisamkeit," he said.

I mostly enjoyed "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow". While the tapestry of the novel is of game development (which hooked me initially), as Zevin puts it, it's really a book about work and love, which stuck with me; namely the passage above.

I'm so thankful for my wife and daughter, but I've had similar feelings of loneliness — lonely while in the company of others — in other parts of my life for far too long. I resolve to change that this year.
