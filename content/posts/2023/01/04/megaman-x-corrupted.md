This is a seriously impressive fan-made Mega Man project. Gorgeous Mega Man X art. Multiple missions. Metroidvania style level design. And incredible soundtrack by [Dominic Nimark](https://www.youtube.com/@DominicNinmark). (I hear fan-made Mega Man projects are typically high caliber.)

Perhaps foolish, but I find it inspiring when creators invest in their fandoms to breath new life into beloved franchises. I don't know if or how projects like this survive, but I'm certainly rooting for it. Worst case, I hope this catches the attention of Capcom and these folks get picked up for their talents.
