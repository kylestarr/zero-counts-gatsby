[Gilbert Cruz in The New York Times: The Morning newsletter](https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2F6f797850-69f2-52f7-a877-c30c0470f409):

> The world of video games is large indeed. Last year, it encompassed difficult open-world dark fantasy titles like “Elden Ring” (for many, the game of 2022), surprisingly Zen experiences like “PowerWash Simulator” and this one, which I started just before the holidays and am slowly making my way through. “Pentiment” is set in 16th-century Bavaria, and you play as a manuscript illuminator who must eventually investigate a murder. (It sells itself, right?) With a look that tries to approximate medieval art styles, this is a largely text-driven game that becomes more engrossing the longer you play it.

In 2018, _Pentiment_ developers Obsidian Entertainment were acquired by Microsoft, so it doesn't seem fair to call recognition by a widely circulated mainstream newsletter "indie love". But I think it's fair to say _Pentiment_ is a niche game. Within games media, it's been widely discussed/praised — immaculate art design and impressive moral system — but it doesn't seem like a title that would typically garner such placement. "Books-level boring" (in a good way) [per The Besties](https://www.themcelroy.family/2022/12/16/23511914/the-besties-besties-2022-goty-extravaganza-part-one).

I have yet to play _Pentiment_, but the more I hear about it, the more I'm itching to invest in it (after the three books on my nightstand). Very cool placement from The New York Times. Congrats, Obsidian.
