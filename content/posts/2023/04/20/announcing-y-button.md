Today, I'm launching [Y-Button](https://ybutton.online): a podcast that asks why we care about video games.

Since my previous, short-lived video game podcast [Ported](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ported) went on hiatus in 2016, I've been ruminating on what would make a compelling video game podcast. (I'm not exactly sure why Scott Taylor and I stopped recording after only three episodes, but I'm sure we fall into some statistic.) Video games are space I care deeply about, but I'm not exactly sure why. I don't play video games often, but the majority of media I consume — podcasts, news, documentaries — is video game related.

After seven years of asking myself why _I_ care about video games, it dawned on me that maybe I should ask other people why _they_ care about video games. (The realization hit me when I was listening to the [_Smartless_ episode with Rian Johnson](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/23d37b2b/rian-johnson) and he and Will Arnett went on a tangent about games.)

Y-Button will feature interviews with journalists, enthusiasts, creators, and media personalities covering their origins with video games, why they care about the medium, and what excites them about the future. I'm starting with some friends and aquaintences, but the goal is to branch out to both well known industry insiders and celebrities you may not have known had a passion for video games. Dream guests include Kumail Nanjiani, Emily Gordon, AOC, Chrissy Teigen, Rian Johnson, and Will Arnett to name a few. If you know any of these folks, hook it up! (The late Lance Reddick was also a huge source of inspiration and would have been a great get. RIP.)

Publishing this podcast is a source of immense excitement and anxiety for me. Worst case, I'm very proud of the name and cover art. I spent two nights learning Blender to create the 3D rendered button — my first experience with 3D modeling. I also wrote [the theme song](https://music.apple.com/us/album/on-the-same-page-feat-scott-wilkie/1679473967?i=1679473968) featuring my friend Scott Wilkie on a Minimoog with the direction, "make it sound like Steve Winwood".

I hope you listen, provide constructive feedback, and maybe even suggest or connect me with a guest you'd like to hear on the podcast. It's available wherever you find your podcasts including [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/y-button/id1683256695) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0peqw07cM0a6nU5bHMmNan).

Enjoy the show.
