[Jack Billings (Billy Crudup), _Hello Tomorrow!_ (Apple TV+)](https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/your-brighter-tomorrow-today/umc.cmc.674xap9t3t7pfc9o1y61rngr5):

> Explain this to me… we live with miracles at our finger tips. We fly to the stars. We split atoms. We've got robots taking out the trash. Why are we all still waiting to live our dreams? Well, there's a technical term for that in my business: That's call a "shit deal". Our best days: they're piling up in the rearview. And that hope that keeps us going: it's wearing down to the bone. Some of us are losing people we love. And just like that “any day now”, that turns into “too late”. Gone forever. Because every day that we're not living for Now — Right Now — we're waiting around dying. One empty promise at a time. I'm not waiting around anymore, goddammit. Neither should you. The time is Now. And regret's a killer worse than death.

Great writing that shook me out of a funk. Put it next to "[I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMVMbmQBug)"
