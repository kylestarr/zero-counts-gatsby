[Sam Machkoveh, Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/twenty-years-later-i-still-remember-powering-the-n64-on-for-the-first-time/):


<blockquote>Perhaps most notably, this was the last console on which Nintendo could rehash its older characters and series without fielding non-stop complaints about "sequelitis." The console's best first-party games were mostly sequels—_Super Mario 64_, _Ocarina of Time_, _Mario Kart 64_, _Star Fox 64_, _F-Zero X_, even _Wave Race 64_ and _Excitebike 64_—and yet all of them felt incredibly new thanks to their steps up to fully 3D engines. Nintendo had been a purely 2D game-making company for nearly a decade, yet it somehow pulled off the transition to 3D gaming in pretty much every way that Sega flubbed its own total overhaul.</blockquote>


Yours truly, in a November 2014 post titled [_Iterative vs. Redesigned Experiences_](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/11/22/iterative-vs-redesign/):


<blockquote>If the doomsayers are correct and Nintendo’s failure is eminent, redesigns are going to be required to prevent it. So far, the majority of first-party titles on Wii U are iterative: _Mario Kart 8_, _Super Smash Bros. Wii U_, _Super Mario 3D World_, _Pikmin 3_, _Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze_. While not every redesign has worked in Nintendo’s favor (I'm looking at you, [_Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is genius_](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/11/captain-toad-is-genius/); while it’s not a new take on a old classic (because there is no old classic!), it’s a new perspective from the Mushroom Kingdom. Until then, it’s back to smashing and karting.</blockquote>


_Pokémon Go_ was the most recent example of a redesigned rather than iterative experience. Real-world Pokémon is an experience many fans have yearned for since the days of Red and Blue (or Green). Nintendo's decision to make Niantic, Inc.'s _Ingress_ a venue for real-world Pokémon was not only brilliant, but for a company that's built their namesake on changing our perspectives, hidden-in-plain-sight.

With surprise experiences like _Pokémon Go_ and Nintendo's further foray into the new terrian of smartphone hardware, we are sure to see at least a handful of  redesigned experiences on mobile. With the NX, my hopes are not so high. But if anyone can reimagine the console experience, it's Nintendo.
