Parents surrender their phones and tablets to their children. E.g. child clamours for device—iPhone, iPad, or otherwise—the parent surrenders said device to child. Child commences gaming and/or YouTube.

This is anecdotal, of course. My wife and I have no children. But we've seen this time and time again with friends and family.

And if it's not the guardian's own device, it's a separate device dedicated to gaming and/or YouTube for the child.

From the POV of a parent, wouldn't it be nice to keep your device on your own person?

From the POV of a child, wouldn't it be nice to have your own device dedicated for gaming/YouTube without the other unnecessary calendar/email/messages/etc apps?

Enter the Nintendo Switch. A dedicated seemingly state-of-the-art-ish portable/home console multiplayer-ready uncompromised gaming device, surely ready for YouTube when on wifi (an optional data plan would be even better), by the greatest game designers on the planet, Nintendo.

While **none** of the talent in the trailer appear to be under the age of 20—even donning _red cups_ at a rooftop party!—the Switch could be a game changer for the household.

Of course, it will come down to Nintendo's ability to attract third-party devs—a feat they have struggled with since the Nintendo 64. And not just any third-party titles, but titles outside of Nintendo's own legacy: education, infants, toddlers, etc. Lock down the third-parties with simple development and distribution, and (price willing) the Switch will be a boon for parents and children alike.

Children: here's a device for the things you care about.

Parents: take your devices back.
