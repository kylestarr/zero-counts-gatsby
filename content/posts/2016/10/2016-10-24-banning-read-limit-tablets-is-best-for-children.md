[Christopher Mims, The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/banning-tablets-is-best-for-children-1477245370):


<blockquote>Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics validated my experiment, recommending that children younger than 18 months get zero screen time, and those ages 2 to 5 be limited to one hour a day—half of its prior recommendation. The group recommended that the hour be “high quality programming” that parents watch with their children.</blockquote>


Later in the piece, Paul Bettner, co-creator of Words With Friends and founder of Playful Corp:


<blockquote>“I’ve seen from my own life and my children that there’s great social interaction, great hand-eye coordination stuff, lots of storytelling and getting involved in the narrative, a lot of learning and skill building when children play videogames alone or together,” says Mr. Bettner. He limits his children to two to three hours a day, and encourages them to play videogames rather than watch shows.</blockquote>


In my post Nintendo Switch and Parents, I wanted specify that while the Switch might be a boon to both parents and children, by no means should a device be used as a replacement for babysitting nor physical modes of play.

I think the title of this Mims's piece is misleading. That said, I like Bettner's philosophy.
