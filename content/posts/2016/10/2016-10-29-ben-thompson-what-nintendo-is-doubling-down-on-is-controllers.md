[Ben Thompson, in his latest weekly free Stratechery piece, "Surface Studio, Nintendo Switch, and Niche Strategies"](https://stratechery.com/2016/surface-studio-nintendo-switch-and-the-potential-of-niche/):


<blockquote>What Nintendo is doubling down on is controllers, another smart move. I [argued in 2014](https://stratechery.com/2014/games-good-enough/) that controllers are so important to the user experience of consoles that they will hold off general purpose devices like Apple TVs when it comes to living room gaming; Nintendoâ€™s bet is that they can attract gamers who want mobility by offering high fidelity control that smartphones can not[4](x-webdoc://BA731C71-B070-4D2D-8827-0F7AA282089E#footnote_3_2335).</blockquote>


First and foremost, you should subscribe to Ben's [Daily Update](https://stratechery.com/membership/). $10 per month gets you _the_ best business/technology analysis out there.

Second, Ben's observation is something I should have realized and mentioned in my ["Nintendo Switch and Parents"](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/10/21/nintendo-switch-and-parents/) piece. As a reminder, I wrote the following, emphasis just now added:


<blockquote>Enter the Nintendo Switch. A dedicated seemingly state-of-the-art-ish portable/home console multiplayer-ready _uncompromised_ gaming device, surely ready for YouTube when on wifi (an optional data plan would be even better), by the greatest game designers on the planet, Nintendo.</blockquote>


By uncompromised, I was eluding to those features we consider critical to console gaming: power, fidelity, and breadth. One item that skipped my thought was physical controllers. Because physical controllers have been a staple of console gaming since the beginning, it was easy to overlook. But the importance of Nintendo doubling-down on physical controllers for the Switch, seemingly ignoring touchscreen capabilities based on the [Switch trailer](http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13379434/nintendo-switch-secret-projector) (however, [patents may reveal otherwise](http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13379434/nintendo-switch-secret-projector)), cements the vision, nay dream of portable console-level gaming.
