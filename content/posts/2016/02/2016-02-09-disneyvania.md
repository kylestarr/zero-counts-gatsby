The release and my playthrough of _The Witness_ happened to coincide with a ramp-up in my video game podcast consumption. (Maybe not so much a coincidence than a subconscious attempt to glean a hints from podcasters.) Through this, I came across a couple of keen observations of the game's design that I had not considered:

_[Idle Thumbs, ep 248, 14:55](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/idle-thumbs-248-bears-black/id293436552?i=361890501&mt=2)_:


<blockquote>**Jake Rodkin**: It uses so many rules of Disneyland-esque design and video game level design to make it easy to navigate, but it's not built assuming there's that huge framework of video game messaging beneath it.

**Chris Remo**: That Disneyland thing is a good comparison. Video game designers have often—for good reason—and accurately pointed to Disneyland as a really useful design touchstone. Not for the experience of the rides themselves, but for the design of the actual park.

**JR**: Disneyland is the closest we have in real life to a constructed open-world level.

**CR**: Areas are connected where there's an intuitive sense of structure, but when you're _in_ any given place, it feels like it's entirely enveloping you.

**JR**: Until you come around a corner and then the foliage and architecture perfectly frames on a sightline – spire that is in a waypoint to a different land of the park.

**CR**: And The Witness is totally like that.</blockquote>


I completely agree. The _Idle Thumbs_ crew may also have unraveled a core reason why I loved _Myst_ so much. And quite possibly why I love Disneyland so much.

<blockquote>This is a secret Metroidvania game. In a _Metroid_ game, you get to an area. You can't get far. You go off to a different area. You find a power-up. (In this case, the power-ups are not items you find in the game. It's the knowledge that you gain through working out a different set of puzzles.) You get frustrated. You go off to a different area. You learn something. You come back. Boom! You get through.

Sometimes you can "bomb-jump" your way around it by figuring out something by being clever that you got a little ahead of. Or a little more doggedness or experimentation. It's a neat game.</blockquote>


A very neat game.
