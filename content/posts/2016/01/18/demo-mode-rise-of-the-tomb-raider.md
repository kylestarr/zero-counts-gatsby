In the shadow of Naughty Dog's _Uncharted_ series, I'm not entirely sure it's fair to say Square Enix's 2013 _Tomb Raider_ reboot set a bar, but it certainly showed that Square Enix has the chops to add a fair contender to the photorealistic action-adventure genre. To say it another way, if it weren't for the lack of wit, I wouldn't have been surprised if Nathan Drake made a cameo. That is a compliment.

_Uncharted_ similarities aside, I imagine _Tomb Raider_ was a welcome reboot of the franchise. Missing a chance with the original _Tomb Raider_ series, 2013's _Tomb Raider_ was my first-ever jaunt with Lara Croft, and it certainly had me yearning for adventures with her. The mechanics felt nice. There were enough collectibles to make its linear nature feel a bit more open. And it was certainly gorgeous.

However, having never played the original _Tomb Raider_ series from the late-90s, I was unfamiliar with the concept of raiding tombs. Thinking back on my play-through, the reboot had very little to do with it's namesake. Many _Tomb Raider_ reviews called out the lack of the core aspect of the franchise. In any case, my enjoyment with the reboot left me unquestioning of the game's title.

Square Enix's sequel/prequel (the trial doesn't paint a fair picture of the timeline) _Rise of the Tomb Raider_ appears to have a greater focus on tomb raiding. Various reviews have highlighted that this new focus paired with an open-world nature make for a compelling follow-up and something that is varied enough from the first.

During the _Rise of the Tomb Raider_ trial, I did not have an opportunity to experience either of these aspects. It opens with the player scaling an icy and crumbing mountainside — an _Uncharted 2_ opening train-scene equivalent — to a lost city and a tomb within. The visuals are stunning and, like the first, the mechanics feel polished. (This coming off of _Assassin's Creed: Syndicate_ which feel clunky to a franchise novice. A story for another post.) After entering the ruins of the lost city, the player is treated with a fairly simple puzzle of rising water and platforming. Unchallenging, but it gives the impression that this type of puzzling will be core to the remainder of the game.

The hour-long trial is ripe with cinematics: the opening, a few during the mountain climb, a flashback highlighting Lara's father, and the ending. I'd hope that the remainder of the game strays away from the heavy-handed cinematics and quicktime events, opting to focus more on puzzling within tombs. The trial ends in a rushed cinematic with an unnamed baddie, a "shootout" with two henchmen, and a race out of the tomb before it comes crashing down.

Without relying too heavily on reviews elsewhere, the trial of _Rise of the Tomb Raider_ feels like more of the same, albeit a bit prettier than the first title in the franchise.
