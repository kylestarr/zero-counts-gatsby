[Rich McCormick, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10707382/zelda-ocarina-of-time-beaten-blind-gamer):


<blockquote>His final video, uploaded on January 2nd, shows him using the same method to defeat Ganon, the game's pig-faced final boss. Particularly important in Garrett's playthrough was the use of the hookshot — a _Zelda_ mainstay that fires a retractable chain — as a form of echolocation. When Garrett fired it against a wall, he'd hear a telltale clang; if he fired it into thin air, it would reach the end of its tether before returning to his hand, spooling backwards with a different noise.</blockquote>


Utterly fascinating. Congratulations, Terry!
