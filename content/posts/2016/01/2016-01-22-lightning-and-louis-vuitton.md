[Teddy Dief, developer of Hyper Light Drifter and Kyoto Wild, writing for Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/22/10806962/fashion-video-games-final-fantasy-13-lightning):


<blockquote>Square Enix — a major international video game company — thinks that the Louis Vuitton-wearing chic folk of the world might sometimes come home from their fancy parties and boot up their PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. Or you know what? Their Wii U. The fashion in _[Splatoon](http://www.polygon.com/game/splatoon/37476)_ is so fresh that [it's inspiring a massive fan zine](http://splatzine.tumblr.com/).

I mean, I'm excited because this is further evidence that the world outside video game enthusiast culture is acknowledging that:

> 
> 
	  * Games are for adults too!
	  * Game players have fashion sense!
	  * There are a lot of women playing games!
	  * Fashionistas might be super into turn-based combat!

The stereotypes of old are toppling left and right! It's a delicious massacre.

[…]

Imagine what could happen!

	  * "Diesel to release a line of Bayonetta-inspired pants"
	  * "Nintendo reveals Ralph Lauren outfit DLC for [Super Smash Bros.](http://www.polygon.com/game/super-smash-bros/6684)"
	  * "Lululemon teams up with _[Hyper Light Drifter](http://www.polygon.com/game/hyper-light-drifter/14957)_ for a new line of athletic wear"

</blockquote>


The three Final Fantasy games centered around Lightning each take [an average of 37.5 hours to beat](http://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=3532). If these Louis Vuitton designs were to become available in-game, that's an unprecedented amout of product placement screen time.
