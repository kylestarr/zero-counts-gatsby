[Chris Plante in his first piece since returning to Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/11/16277334/the-best-video-games):


<blockquote>I love video games, but what I might love more is the opportunity I’ve had over the last decade to share the imperfect games with other people, people who might have otherwise passed them on their occasional visit to GameStop in search of _Madden_ or _Destiny_, _Grand Theft Auto_ or _Call of Duty_. I like finding greatness in the world’s biggest games, too, but I recognize they set an expectation of polish and scope that so many games can’t match. When I criticize a game, I do so to set expectations, to provide context, to interrogate what doesn’t work and to shine a light on what does.</blockquote>


This is exactly how I used to approach music and how I currently approach books. With music, it used to be a mainstream vs. indie thing, but I've learned to appreciate the big budget works for what they're worth as well. With books, it's less about popularity and more about topics—granularity.

In any case, it's great to see Plante back at it. A stellar writer and critic. We're lucky to read his work.
