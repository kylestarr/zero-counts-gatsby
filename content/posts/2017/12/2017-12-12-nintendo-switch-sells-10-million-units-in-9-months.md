[Wow](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/171212.html). 10 million units in 282 days.

Note the Wii U had lifetime sales of 13.56 million units. The highly successful PS4 sold 10 million units in 268 days. The Xbox One sold _nearly_ 10 million in 355 days.

[What a year](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/11/28/big-ns-big-year/) it has been for Nintendo and the Switch.

[_Correction_: I originally posted that the PS4 sold 10 million units in 10 months, out-paced by the Switch. [This was incorrect](https://twitter.com/zhugeex/status/940679687583477761).]
