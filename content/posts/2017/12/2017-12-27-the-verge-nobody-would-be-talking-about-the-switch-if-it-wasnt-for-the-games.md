[Andrew Webster on Nintendo's A+ "Verge 2017 tech report card"](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/27/16812488/2017-tech-recap-nintendo-switch-zelda-mario-odyssey):


<blockquote>Hardware has rightfully been the focal point of Nintendo’s 2017, but nobody would be talking about the Switch if it wasn’t for the games. And _Zelda_ isn’t enough to make a successful console. That was one of the Wii U’s biggest issues; while it had some excellent titles, there were often months that went between notable releases. Since the Switch debuted in March, Nintendo has released a steady stream of acclaimed games, several which were ports or sequels to Wii U games that not enough people played. [_Mario Kart 8_](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14880610/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-overview-trailer)[ got a deluxe edition](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14880610/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-overview-trailer), for instance, while the colorful shooter [_Splatoon_](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15986256/splatoon-2-nintendo-switch-review)[ received a revamped sequel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15986256/splatoon-2-nintendo-switch-review). And while most of the third-party games on Switch were ports, with older games like _LA Noire_ and _Skyrim_, they felt new and exciting again on the hardware.

I still believe there is a valid debate for [Nintendo's greater achievement of 2017](https://twitter.com/_kylestarr/status/934552803938205696): The Switch or _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_.
