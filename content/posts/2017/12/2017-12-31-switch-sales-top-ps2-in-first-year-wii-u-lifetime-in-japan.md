[Allegra Frank, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/29/16829726/nintendo-switch-sales-numbers-japan-fastest-selling-console):


<blockquote>Nintendo Switch has had a huge December over in Japan, with nearly 900,000 systems sold by Dec. 24. Based on the most recent [cumulative sales data](https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/946202445515915264) from [Famitsu](https://www.famitsu.com/biz/ranking/), the country’s biggest gaming publication, Nintendo has now sold just under 3.3 million Switch consoles in its homeland — both edging out PlayStation 2’s first-year sales numbers and matching Wii U’s lifetime sales to date.

</blockquote>

Astonishing.
