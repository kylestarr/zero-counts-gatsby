[Victor Luckerson recapping Nintendo's year as "The Best Tech Story of 2017"for The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2017/12/7/16746390/nintendo-2017-switch-snes-classic-wii-u):


<blockquote>It all seemed like enough to burn through the last of gamers’ goodwill for the often maddening company. But then Nintendo released _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, and a lifetime’s worth of anti-consumer transgressions were suddenly forgiven. In an era filled with cynical IP cash-ins across entertainment, Nintendo used a formulaic, nostalgic franchise to deliver a fresh reinvention of open-world gaming mechanics. The game is an adept mix of old and new, borrowing elements of Skyrim and Minecraft but augmenting them to recreate the whimsy, mystery, and intrepidness that a lot of gamers felt the first time they booted up the original Legend of Zelda or the seminal Ocarina of Time. The gushing praise for the game, the [best-reviewed title](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/all/filtered) of the year, proved that endlessly cynical gamers will always have a soft spot for a Nintendo classic done right.

Zelda immediately transformed the Switch from a curiosity to a must-have gadget. Gamers like Yai Torres, a 30-year-old resident of Arlington, Virginia, who had skipped out on the Wii U, got the system the day it launched. “It’s been a while since I’ve had a Nintendo product but I’ve always been a follower in terms of the latest games,” Torres says. “The fact that they had such a cool console with such a cool game clicked for me.”

[I'm still pondering](https://twitter.com/_kylestarr/status/934552803938205696) whether _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ may be a bigger achievement than the Switch. Would Nintendo have had such a stellar year if the Switch launched with _Super Mario Odyssey_?

(Aside: Fun to see Victor end his piece where I was originally going to begin [mine](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/11/28/big-ns-big-year/): the insanity of 2017.)
