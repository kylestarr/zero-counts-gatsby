[Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/nintendo-of-america-launches-nintendo-power-podcast):


<blockquote>Nintendo of America has released the very first episode of its new Nintendo Power Podcast. With Nintendo Power Podcast, Nintendo employees, developers and special guests discuss the world of Nintendo – from Mario to the Legend of Zelda, and everything in between.

The first episode of the powered-up podcast features an in-depth interview with Nintendo developers Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi about the making of _[the Legend of Zelda™: Breath of the Wild ](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/)_game.

Also, Nintendo of America employees Chris Slate (previously editor-in-chief of _Nintendo Power_™ magazine), Damon Baker (from Publisher and Developer Relations) and Kit Ellis (co-host of Nintendo’s weekly YouTube show Nintendo Minute) take a look back at Nintendo’s action-packed 2017.

I missed the boat on the original Nintendo Power magazine. As a Genesis kid, Nintendo Power was the extra flair that made me envious of my NES and SNES owning [schoolyard](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/03/13/the-schoolyard-is-the-entirety-of-the-internet/) peers. A brilliant marketing gimmick that helped build Nintendo's IP into cultural touchstones for our generation.

Hearing word of Nintendo's newly launched Nintendo Power Podcast rekindled those old memories — a new marketing gimmick and bolstering of IP for a new generation. And I'm happy to report that the podcast is a quality production that extends beyond news and marketing fluff. The banter from hosts Slate, Baker, and Ellis is honest and really no different than some of my favorite podcasting cross-talk, but with nice perspective from within the company. The quiz section is a great hit of nostalgia. And the interview with Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi sheds light on much of the design origins and thinking behind one of the greatest games ever made.

It is with relief that I see potential for depth in this show. It seems Nintendo understands the overlap of podcast consumers and Switch owners — [77% of podcast consumers range between the ages of 18-54](http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Podcast-Consumer-2017.pdf); [80% of Switch owners range between the ages of 19-44](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2017/171031_2e.pdf). That's not a market for pure marketing fluff.

The final touch of polish is that n the theme; an evolution of of Nintendo console sound design. It reminded me of the logo I designed for the [Ported Key](https://www.zerocounts.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/portedkey-large-2.jpg).
