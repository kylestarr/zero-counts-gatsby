[Andrew Goldfarb reporting for IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/29/nintendo-explains-how-switch-reaffirms-the-value-of-portable-gaming):

> According to Koizumi, part of Switch's appeal may be the hardware itself, which allows playing to be a different social experience than smartphones can offer.

> “Just to add a little bit to this idea of how people viewing smartphones as an influence on the future of portable gaming, I certainly wanted to see all the possibilities of having controllers that could be separated from the hardware, so that you could be able to hand one to another person in a variety of different environments,” Koizumi added. “I think that really represents an amazing advantage over smartphones. That was something that we had focused on very clearly as something we could achieve to reach that distinction.”

It may not add much weight, but here's an image after my younger cousins swarmed me at Christmas, asking if I owned the Switch:
