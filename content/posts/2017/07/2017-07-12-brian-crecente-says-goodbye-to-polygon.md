[Brian Crecente](https://www.polygon.com/forums/meta/2017/7/11/15955974/crecente-out):


<blockquote>[So I wrapped things up at Kotaku](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiZ4cDyhoLVAhXDKiYKHSWRBf4QFggrMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2F5872606%2Fadieu&usg=AFQjCNGp-6gu9AGVVLSnNMzjSoeGcWVg8g) and joined Grant and crew to help launch Polygon. Then somehow five years whipped by and before I knew it I went from covering [presidential press conferences](https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/16/3882728/obama-calls-for-research-into-link-between-video-games-and-violence) and breaking news on [new games](https://www.polygon.com/2012/12/20/3789022/disney-infinity) to spending my days writing about [esoteric pinball machines](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi15aOsh4LVAhXIYiYKHbmpB24QFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ffeatures%2F2017%2F3%2F21%2F14937540%2Fhistory-of-big-bang-bar-pinball&usg=AFQjCNFK1fD5IMM8rntU0rAnAFm9eKYKQA) or the [state of gaming and game culture in Cuba](https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/15/15625636/cuba-video-games).

When Rolling Stone contacted me about joining the magazine on its 50th anniversary, I simply couldn't say no. I've spent more than a dozen years talking about how I wanted to build the Rolling Stone of gaming publications. Where better to do that then at [Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/glixel)?</blockquote>


I've always looked forward to Brian's work on [Zero Counts was founded upon a very similar message](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/12/30/2014-zero-counts-launch-greatest-hits/).

[Glixel](http://www.glixel.com) (Rolling Stone's gaming vertical) has been publishing some spectacular pieces as of late. I'm very excited to see how Brian's legacy and institutional knowledge from Kotaku and Polygon bolster Glixel.
