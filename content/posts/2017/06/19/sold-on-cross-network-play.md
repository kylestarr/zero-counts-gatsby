During the Nintendo Spotlight: E3 2017, cult favorite _Rocket League_ was announced for the Switch. The announcement included the bullet point "Cross-Network play", officially detailed on [RocketLeague.com](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-nintendo-switch-holiday-2017/), emphasis my own:


<blockquote>_Rocket League_ will also support all of Nintendo Switch’s play modes, including TV Mode (docked), Tabletop Mode, Handheld Mode, and both Online and Local Multiplayer. Online Multiplayer supports up to eight players, and _Cross-Network play will be supported as well, allowing Switch players to hit the field with players on Steam and Xbox One_.</blockquote>


The idea that I can play the exact same game with a friend on a different console should not be novel. It is a future I've been hoping for, and honestly, a no brainer from a consumer's perspective.

For non-exclusives, I don't want to have think about shutting out some of my friends based on a console decision. A handful of my friends prefer playing on Xbox One. Another handful prefer playing on PlayStation 4. I'm caught in the middle and certainly don't want to purchase the game twice. (Nor should I be expected to own both consoles!)

Without the knowledge of different online communities, buying a game as a gift can be a tremulous experience for family and friends. Confusion exists for the non-gaming community. There are horror stories of purchasing Wii U games for Wii owners. Hell, there was confusion between NES and SNES games back in the '90s. I would argue that purchasing a game for the correct console, but being locked out of playing with friends simply because they own a different console sounds like lunacy to those without gaming knowledge.

However, as [Myke Hurley on the _Remaster_ podcast points out](https://www.relay.fm/remaster/37), PlayStation will not be partaking.:


<blockquote>It's very awesome that [_Rocket League_] has Cross-Network play. You'll be able to play against players on other platforms. This is just PC and Xbox right now, which is the same for _Minecraft_. With the new _Minecraft_, you will sign in with an Xbox Live account to play on the Switch. So this is something it seems like a bunch of different game companies are getting together with one notable absent platform which is PlayStation.</blockquote>


This is not a technical limitation. [It is political](https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/13/15794464/sony-cross-platform-play-rocket-league-minecraft).

[Jeremy Dunham, VP of publishing at Psyonix, in an interview with Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2017/6/13/15795376/rocket-league-cross-platform-playstation-4):


<blockquote>“It’s literally something we could do with a push of a button, metaphorically,” Dunham told Polygon. “In reality it’s a web page with a checkbox on it. All we have to do is check that box and it would be up and running in less than an hour all over the world. That’s all we need to do.”</blockquote>


As an owner of all three consoles, the gesture of Cross-Network play between Xbox One and Switch — even between two games, _Rocket League_ and _Minecraft_ — is enough to push me over the edge of purchasing and playing third-party titles available for both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on Xbox One.

Cross-Network play is the future for third-party titles and I have faith Sony will follow suit. Until then, whenever I'm debating which "HD twin" to play third-party multiplayer experiences on, Xbox One gets my money, simply on the potential that their willingness will bring more shared Cross-Network play experiences.
