[Yahoo's Ben Silverman and host Jeff Cannata on the DLC podcast](http://5by5.tv/dlc/185):


<blockquote>**Ben Silverman**: I think the problem wasn't that there were fans there, I just think that no one was prepared for this. The management of the [Los Angeles Convention Center] didn't route people in ways that made sense. It was just like everyone go and charge through these gigantic halls. The booths weren't set up to handle that crush of fans.

On the first night — Tuesday night — Nintendo furiously reorganized their booth so that Wednesday and Thursday it would make more sense.

**Jeff Cannata**: And kudos to them because they did a great job. Tuesday it was literally just a sea of people at the Nintendo booth. It was _unmanageable_, completely. And kudos to them for staying up late that night and figuring it out. They had structure that really worked for the rest of the show. I mean, it was a six hour line — I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy — but it still at least allowed movement through their booth.</blockquote>


My friend and I took note of Nintendo's queue management restructure on Wednesday as well. It was very cool to see. However, the lines for _Super Mario Odyssey_ remained completely insane, but at least there _were_ lines.

[I mentioned](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/06/19/e3-2017/) that my friend and I lucked out in playing _Super Mario Odyssey_. Wednesday morning, after being let into the LACC, we beelined it for _Super Mario Odyssey_, but were discouraged to find that the line was already three hours long. A Nintendo booth actor/temp — dressed in a New Donk City themed suit and fedora no less — whispered "a secret" that the attendees sitting on a bench behind us with Switches in handheld mode were actually partaking in the demo. To a passerby, they looked like attendees playing on their own consoles. We were none the wiser until the fedora-clad "Donkian" gave us the [coat full of contraband](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatFullOfContraband?from=Main.YouWannaBuyAWatch) treatment. (I don't think he was in character, but it fit the bill.) We immediately formed a line next to the bench, sparking another lengthy queue.

In all fairness, the actor/temp should have informed those waiting in the longer line that the Switches on the bench were demo units as well, long before my friend and I arrived. On the flip side, the lengthy _Super Mario Odyssey_ line was a for a docked Switch with headphones — the full console experience. The bench Switches were portable mode only and did not feature audio, one of my favorite elements of Mario games.
