[Takashi Mochizuki, The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-developing-the-legend-of-zelda-smartphone-game-1494820189):


<blockquote>Nintendo Co. plans to bring its videogame franchise “The Legend of Zelda” to smartphones, people familiar with the matter said, the latest step by the Kyoto company to expand its mobile-games lineup.</blockquote>


More often than not, it feels like WSJ — Mochizuki in particular — is breaking Nintendo news these days. At the very least, Mochizuki has a keen eye on the beat. Never have I been so inclined to pay for The Wall Street Journal, which paints a picture of Nintendo's audience as much as it does The Journal's.

Here are some other recent scoops from Mochizuki:

5/1: [Nintendo Shipped Switch Consoles by Plane to Quickly Meet High Demand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-shipped-switch-consoles-by-plane-to-quickly-meet-high-demand-1493619178)

3/17: [Nintendo to Double Production of Switch Console](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-to-double-production-of-switch-console-1489728545)

Side-note: I really like how tapping/clicking a WSJ byline reveals the writer's bio, Twitter handle, and email address — a treatment I've never realized I've always wanted.
