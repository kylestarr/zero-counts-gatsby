[Walt Williams in his book ‘Significant Zero’](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Significant-Zero/Walt-Williams/9781501129957):


<blockquote>A traditional game is a challenge in which a player’s skill comes up again a rigid set of rules. Turn-based strategy, multiplayer death match, platformers—these are traditional. The modern, high-end, blockbuster AAA game is not a skill challenge. If it were, the player might fail and be disappointed, and then we wouldn’t sell as many copies. The rules are fluid. We change them to create tension, surprise, or excitement. Saying yes to the player only goes so far, and that distance is the exact length required to make you feel in control.

</blockquote>

Last week, a colleague of mine asked how far I was into _Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle_. I told him that I was in the middle of the fourth (and possibly last) stage — Lava Pit. (For what it’s worth, I had recommended the game to him.) I also told him that playing _Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle_ was the most fun I’d had with a video game in a long time. _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ was great, but the aesthetic doesn’t draw me back. Likewise, _Splatoon 2_ is lots of fun, but only in casual, Mario Kart-style doses. _Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battlle_ has me not only progressing through the main campaign, but backtracking to achieve better, cleaner results in previous battles and optional challenges.

Right now, it seems the “traditional” game is where I find fulfillment. When life feels like a maze, solving simple, zero-stakes problems — in a world you adore — is unbelievably gratifying.

If platformers fit into this bucket, then boy, oh boy am I looking forward to _Super Mario Odyssey_.
