[Chaim Gartenberg, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14526666/nintendo-new-3ds-xl-stock-issues-sold-out-switch-third-party-grey-market):


<blockquote>To put it plainly, with the Nintendo Switch launch right around the corner, the current inability to purchase the 3DS should seriously worry anyone without a preorder in place. Because if the Switch turns out to be as successful as the NES Classic or 3DS have been, fans could be facing yet another tough choice between a long wait or a grey market gouging for a Nintendo console.</blockquote>


Looking on Target.com, there's not a single 3DS within 100 miles of Palo Alto. 250 miles on BesyBuy.com. Prime availability through Amazon is limited to Pikachu Yellow and Pokémon 20th Anniversary XL editions for $300+ through forth-parties. A new 3DS XL retails for $199. The Switch retails for $299.

I've shared Gartenberg's concern since missing the Switch's pre-order allotment. Not to mention the continued unavailability of the NES Classic. And being the dummy I am, I already traded my Wii U in at GameStop in anticipation of the Switch's March 3 release date—$200 burning a hole in my pocket. This is crazy. At the very least, take my order and send when ready.

I've got a feeling I'll be staring at my copy of _Breath of the Wild_ longingly for a while.
