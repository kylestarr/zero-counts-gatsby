[Tyrone Rodriguez, the president of Nicalis, speaking to Polygon about developing for Nintendo platforms](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14554702/nintendo-switch-indie-friendly-binding-of-isaac-nicalis-tyrone-rodriguez):


<blockquote>“The Switch is, by far the easiest and most programmer friendly so far,” he said. “I know this sounds like lip service to Nintendo, but it’s actually not. If this wasn’t true, we wouldn’t be able to get these games up and running as quickly as we have, and we wouldn’t be able to have a launch title. It’s light years ahead of what we were doing with Wii U.”</blockquote>


Nicalis has developed 18 games, eight of which shipped to Nintendo platforms—all eight to 3DS, two of which hit Wii U.
