[GameStop press release](http://investor.gamestop.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2248270):


<blockquote>This just in: GameStop, a family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple, announced stores will have a limited supply of Nintendo Switch systems available for walk-in customers on the March 3 launch day. Customers who were not able to pre-order the system are encouraged to attend GameStop’s midnight launch events held at stores across the nation for an opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s revolutionary new home gaming system.</blockquote>


A few thoughts:



 	  1. I'm screwed. Fat chance I'll make a midnight launch. Fatter chance there'll be any [Switch(es)](https://twitter.com/_kylestarr/status/833019191112273920) left around noon in Tahoe. Fattest chance there'll be Switch(es) days/weeks later.
 	  2. Five out of the six sites I found reporting this news did not source GameStop's press release. Not [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/22/14697882/nintendo-switch-launch-gamestop). Not [GameStop](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/limited-supply-of-nintendo-switch-units-will-be-av/1100-6448105/). Not [USA TODAY](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/02/22/gamestop-limited-supply-nintendo-switch-consoles-stores/98247398/). Not [BGR](http://bgr.com/2017/02/22/nintendo-switch-gamestop-midnight-launch/). Not [SlashGear](https://www.slashgear.com/gamestop-will-sell-you-a-nintendo-switch-on-launch-day-if-youre-lucky-22475747/). However, [Tom's Hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/gamestop-sell-nintendo-switch-launch,33707.html) did. Pitiful.
 	  3. "Simple" is the last word I would use to describe GameStop.
