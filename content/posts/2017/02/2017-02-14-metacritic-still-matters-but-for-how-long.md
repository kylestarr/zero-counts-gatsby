[Chris Baker, Glixel](http://www.glixel.com/news/metacritic-still-matters-but-for-how-long-w466884):


<blockquote>The hue and cry around that score is the best evidence that _Metacritic_ deeply matters to many people. And not just fans â€“ the bonus payments that game makers receive from their publishing companies is often tied to the Metascore and those same publishers spend a great deal of time and effort trying to predict the number as it could affect everything from retail orders to returns.

But the games business, and games themselves, are changing. In many ways, a snapshot of what the critical consensus is at the time of launch does not reflect the ultimate nature of a game. Is _Metacritic_ still relevant in this new climate?</blockquote>


A great insight to the inner workings of Metacritic. Must read.
