[Polygon's newly relaunched Besties podcast, January 2017 episode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/besties-pick-best-games-january/id505516789?i=1000381026494&mt=2):


<blockquote>**Chris Plante**: If indie game developers care and the make "the switch" from Vita to this hardware, I'll care. Obviously, that wasn't enough to save the Vita, so I don't see that as a big thing for other people.

**Griffin McElroy**: I think that's a wack comparison.

**CP**: The Wii U had some of the best Nintendo games and that wasn't even close to enough to get people interested.

**Russ Frushtick**: Consider that the Vita died primarily because Sony was dividing their time and energy between the PS4 and the Vita and they eventually gave up. Indies filled in a lot of the blanks, but the most part they just gave up and third-parties gave up, etc. Here Nintendo's obviously not going to give up because it's their primary console now.

**CP**: They won't give up unless nobody buys it, which is a very real possibility if there are no games from Nintendo or third-party studios.

**RF**: There are certainly two to three years of Nintendo games pretty much guaranteed.

**CP**: But like I said, that's not enough. That just doesn't work at all for Nintendo. When it doesn't have third-party developers and it doesn't have a mainstream gimmick—something that's going to make people who watch the TODAY Show be like, "Well, I've never bought a video game console, but I'll try this," then it doesn't have it.

**GM**: It's not going to be the Wii. It'll never be the Wii. They'll never do the Wii ever again.

**RF**: The Wii was an aberration.

**CP**: That's a for real problem for them. The thing that they have to [face] right now is, "We are the second console." If they truly don't get third-party support and they only have a new game every five or six months—let's be super generous and say three—then that is a second console for people, which is big money. And unlike the Wii U, which only had to be competing as a second console against people who maybe already owned an Xbox and instead of a PS4 they might buy a Wii U. Now they have to compete with the fact that Microsoft and Sony are going to be releasing new hardware, what, every year? Every other year?</blockquote>


Leave it to Chris Plante to shake me from my Switch hype hypnosis. And I'm glad he did.

I am very much looking forward to the Switch, but Nintendo certainly does not have an easy road ahead of them.
