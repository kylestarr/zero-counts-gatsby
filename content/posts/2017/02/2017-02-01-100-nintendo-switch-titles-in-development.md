[Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima during the Q3 FY2016 financial briefing](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2017/170201_2e.pdf):


<blockquote>Next I will provide a follow-up report about our software publisher partners. After the presentation on January 13, we have continued to receive requests from more and more software publishers who want to develop games for the system. At the presentation, we announced that there were over 80 titles in development from more than 50 software publishers, but that number has now climbed to over 100 titles from more than 70 publishers. Please look forward to more announcements about the software lineup in the future.</blockquote>


[Only 165 Wii U titles were ever released in the US](http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/31/14413160/nintendo-games-by-system-graphic)—the least amount of titles for any Nintendo console—followed by the Nintendo 64's 297.

This third-party interest seems promising.
