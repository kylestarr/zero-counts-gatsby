[Andrew Webster, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14469238/xbox-one-ps4-chinese-indie-games-candle-man):


<blockquote>For 14 years — starting in 2000 — the Chinese government enforced a ban on video game consoles. Between 2014 and 2015, both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 made their long-awaited and overdue debut. Microsoft described its release as a “monumental day” and celebrated by lighting up the Shanghai skyline in bright Xbox green. Sony’s chief executive Kaz Hirai [told _The Telegraph_](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/electronics/10856846/Sonys-Playstation-to-make-China-debut.html) that “I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in [China].”</blockquote>


The lifting of the Chinese console ban is not news, but the fact it was a thing still blows my mind. Where were you in 2000? Can you imagine your life without console games from then til now? It may sound like a silly question, but video games are a massive part of 21st century culture. Wild.

Regardless, a very cool and interesting story.
