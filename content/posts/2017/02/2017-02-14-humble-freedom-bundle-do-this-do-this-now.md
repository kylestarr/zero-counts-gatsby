[Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/freedom):


<blockquote>**Take a stand for freedom. **_Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door._ – "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, from an engraving on the Statue of Liberty.

We humbly remember that the United States is a nation of immigrants, and we proudly stand with developers, authors, and charities that champion liberty and justice for all.

**This special one-week bundle features over $600 in incredible games and books for just $30. 100% of your payments will go to the American Civil Liberties Union, the International Rescue Committee, and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Humble Bundle will proudly match your contributions up to $300,000.**

We chose these three organizations because of the inspiring work they do in providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced people as well as in defense of justice, human rights, and civil rights:</blockquote>


Humble Bundles are a fantastic way to spend your hard earned cash. Here's the deal: you give your money to Humble Bundle and they give you great games, donate your money to amazing charities, and match your donation up to a particular amount. Win, win, win.

I've contributed to a handful of Humble Bundles and I can say the [The Witness](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/03/11/the-witness-a-cheaters-review/)_. Also, _Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP_ is incredible (and has one of the greatest soundtracks ever!), and boy oh boy I can't wait to play [_Stardew Valley_, Polygon's #8 Game of the Year 2016](http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/3/14129368/stardew-valley-games-of-the-year-2016).

Do this. Do this now. Do this for many reasons. But do this now.

(The irony of a charitable organization contributing to your pile of shame!)
