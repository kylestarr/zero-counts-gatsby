[Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi and Shinya Takahashi were interviewed by The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/nintendo-switch-interview-nintendo-price-games-hopes-new-console/). There's not much new in here, other than confirmation of developing for 3DS through 2018, which also plays into a now confirmed mobile strategy:


<blockquote>**Is it more to drive that smartphone audience into buying a Switch? **

**Takahashi**: Certainly one of our goals in releasing software for smart devices that features Nintendo IP is to reach that broader smart device audience and entice them to move towards Nintendo Switch.</blockquote>


By 2018, assuming the Switch can hold its own, I believe price drops will squeeze out a new Nintendo handheld console. (Maybe a mini-Switch is a possibility?)

On possible supply constraints:


<blockquote>**Finally as we head toward launch there has been some reports of stock shortages. Are you confident that anyone that wants a Switch will be able to buy one?**

**Takahashi**: Maybe within the first few days! It does sound like there might be a few shortages here and there, but once you get past that I think we’ll have a very steady flow. Some of our employees are worried about getting one... but we are making a lot!</blockquote>


I'm really hoping this is true.
