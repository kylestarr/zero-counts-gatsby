[John Markoff,  former technology reporter for the New York Times, in an interview on Kara Swisher's Recode Decode podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-need-robots-to-take-our/id1011668648?i=1000380842019&mt=2):


<blockquote>[On the internet, no one still knows you're a dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog). I think identity and the fact that you disconnect [real] identity from your internet identity has proved incredibly vexing for society. It played out in this election. It played out in Brexit. (It was a factor in both—I don't know if it was a deciding factor—but I actually do blame the internet.)

I grew up with [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow) and his manifesto in WIRED in which he argued that cyberspace would be this "Socratian" abode above the grimy politics of the world. Then I realized I was wrong.

The internet is simply a reflection of all the good and the evil in the world.

[...]

What's striking to me is that what the science-fiction world saw in the '80s and '90s has actually come to pass; the cyberpunk sensibility. There was a book written by Vernor Vinge in the early 1980s called [True Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Names). The basic premise of that was you had to basically hide your true name at all costs. It was an insight into the world we're living in today.</blockquote>
