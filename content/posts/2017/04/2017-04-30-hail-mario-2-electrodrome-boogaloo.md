In 2014, I wrote [Hail Mario](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/01/hail-mario/), a post about Nintendo's aggressive strategy to bolster Wii U sales with the release of _Mario Kart 8_:


<blockquote>Nintendo gambled for positive reviews two weeks before launch, is now chalking up at least $40 in games to every US and Canadian Mario Kart owning household, and prays that their Trojan horse will be the spark to move units. Since release, the game has received stunning accolades, [Club Nintendo has been brought down](https://tsogaming.wordpress.com/2014/05/31/club-nintendo-stuck-in-mario-kart-traffic/) by what can only be assumed as immense traffic for free games, and at least one Wii U newcomer is being tugged at by curiosity.

When people think of video games, a large majority picture a mustachioed plumber in a red hat, but Master Chief and the _Minecraft_ universe are only 3 points down. There are still many plays to be made but a well-timed, well-calculated marketing play this big could be enough to save the game. _Mario Kart 8_ may give Nintendo the lead they need to send a message to the HD Twins: Nintendo’s race is not over.

The post was picked up on [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/hail-mario) and is far and away the most popular Zero Counts post. (Thanks, Mr. Gruber!)

_Mario Kart 8_'s early review embargo showed confidence in the game and got media outlets openly singing the game's praises well ahead of release. In addition to building hype, _Mario Kart 8_ came bundled with a free download for one of four AAA games.

For the Switch, Nintendo has released _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ — a slightly enhanced version with a revived and much beloved battle mode and all cups, courses, characters, and DLC unlocked. To add, what I had already considered the best Mario Kart entry to date, can now be taken on the go and played in a myriad of situations — TV or portable; solo, local split screen, or online; out of the box 2-player with Joy-Cons, 8 paired Switches, or 12 player wired LAN. ([Mic has a great breakdown](https://mic.com/articles/175172/mario-kart-8-deluxe-multiplayer-guide-how-many-players-can-race-on-one-nintendo-switch).)

Until this point, the Switch has been a Zelda machine; a single player experience. There were a handful of multiplayer games, but nothing close to a must-have or system seller. With _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_, Nintendo has released the true test of the Switch's promise — console-level gaming with anyone anywhere. How would new Switch players react? Would previous Wii U owners (and likely _Mario Kart 8_ owners) care? How does portable multiplayer hold up?

On _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_'s_ _release day, I brought my Switch to work. It was the perfect venue to test the Switch's out-of-the-box local multi-player experience. In fact, it was the first time I'd attempted _any_ multi-player on the device in _any_ of its various forms. As far as I know, I'm the only one in the office with a Switch. Gasps filled the room when I removed the Joy-Con from the display. I handed one over to a colleague, showed him around the tiny controller, and away we went.

While the 6.2-inch display is fantastic for a single player experience, split-screen is a bit uncomfortable, but not impossible. The fun had over bouts of office Mario Kart eclipsed the discomfort, but it was never completely put it out of our minds. Likewise, a few gripes and cramps were had from the ergonomics when using a single Joy-Con as a primary controller. The situation is tight, but for an experience like _Mario Kart 8_, the pain seemed to be worth the pleasure.

At home, as my wife and I settled into bed, we decided to have a go at one race. I tried to place the Switch on the bed between us — an impossible feat due to the unforgiving kickstand. So, a book was used as the foundation. We peeled away the Joy-Con and we're off to the races. Together we squinted at the tiny screen. I proved to be too uncomfortable for extended periods of play, but we agreed that it would serve well on flights.

The main annoyance came from the placement of the L and R buttons. For her, they felt too close together. To be fair, fitting such a functional controller in the palm a hand is a feat. In fact, there were multiple instances throughout the day when players were shocked to find that the Joy-Con rumbled too.

Breaking out _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ on the Switch is all fun and good, but there's not much for players of the original _Mario Kart 8_. Mario Kart has always been about the party atmosphere, and this version is the ultimate. And I can see myself jumping into a quick pick up game here and there, but otherwise, I've been there done that. There's nothing to unlock. No new cups, courses, or characters. The portability of the Switch paired with Mario Kart plugs a some gaming holes some may never been the wiser, but nothing more than a quick casual experience romp.

I wish I could speak from the newbie to _Mario Kart 8_ experience. For that, see [Jeremy Parish's Retronauts review of ](http://www.retronauts.com/?p=2288)[_Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_](http://www.retronauts.com/?p=2288). It's a fantastic game, but even for newcomers, what does Mario Kart feel like without triumphing for new cups or characters? Does the high polish of Mario Kart 8 hold its luster without striving for something other than victory? Does the out-of-the-box portable multiplayer feel as novel when you haven't played MK8 on a TV for the past few years?

_Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ shows off all the Switch has to offer, but other than pure competition, there's no hook. _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ is a must-have for party moments and quick pick up game, but not a system seller. At least not at $60.

_Update 7/31/18_: Nintendo's FY18 Q2 earning report shows _[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as the second](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)[-](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)[best selling game for the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)_ with 10.35 million units sold; 0.82 million units behind best selling _Super Mario Odyssey_, 1.03 million ahead of third-best selling launch title _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_.

While I'm still bummed by the lack of unlockable achievements and content, enough can't be said about the boundless pick-up-and-play experience of the greatest Mario Kart ever on Nintendo Switch.
