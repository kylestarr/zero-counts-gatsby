[Xavier Poix, Managing Director of Ubisoft’s French studios, in a corporate update interview on UbiBlog](http://blog.ubi.com/en-GB/french-studios-md-xavier-poix-talks-switch/):


<blockquote>**Is the Switch going to revolutionise the market like the Wii did?**

**XP**: The Wii attracted a very large audience – including kids and families – because it offered, on one hand, the motion controls, allowing for intuitive interactions with the console and on the other hand games with a strong social component. These aspects gave us the opportunity to develop _Rabbids_ and _Just Danc_e, for example. The Switch will probably have a similar impact, thanks to the mobility offered by the console. You don’t have to have a home console and a mobile console anymore; there’s one console, which is mobile, that you can bring anywhere.</blockquote>


Nice to see these comments, but that line-up doesn't strike me as all to weighty. I see the value in the audience Ubisoft is targeting, especially after their experiences on the Wii and Wii U, but what of Ubisoft's AAA games like _Assassin's Creed_, _Far Cry,_ and _Watch Dogs_? How will those hold up on the Switch?

And has anyone reported on the Switch's speakers? I can't imagine _Just Dance _being a thrill in handheld mode.
