[Takashi Mochizuki, The Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-to-gamers-try-staring-at-each-other-not-the-screen-1484560118):


<blockquote>Rivals were pursuing high-end games with ever-greater technical sophistication. “We looked back at what Nintendo has done, and when you think about it, it’s really been an amusement provider,” Mr. Koizumi said. The Switch’s concept of playing games anywhere with anyone was born.

“When the concept was set, most of the Switch’s basics came together quickly,” he said. “Things like, you have to be able to take the controller outside, and you’ll need two of them.”

The 48-year-old Mr. Koizumi, who has participated in making titles in popular Nintendo series such as “The Legend of Zelda” and Mario, said one of the first decisions was to attach the two controllers to the console, making a self-contained unit that can be taken anywhere for two-person play.

“You could go out with a hand-held game device, but you can’t play with others if they don’t have the same device,” he said. “We wanted to provide people with more options to play games.”</blockquote>


Mochizuki has done a nice job extracting a top-level perspective of the Switch from his interview with Yoshiaki Koizumi.

Between [Fils-Aimé's comment about consuming Nintendo IP](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/01/15/reggie-fils-aime-i-dont-mind-how-you-interact-with-our-ip-as-long-as-youre-interacting-with-it-every-day/) and Koizumi's amusement provider bit, Nintendo has circled the identity wagons.
