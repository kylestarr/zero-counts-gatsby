I'm proud to say that I played three of the 10 games chosen as [Polygon's 2016 Games of the Year](http://www.polygon.com/2016-game-of-the-year), my reviews of which you can find below:



 	  * [_Inside_: A Review via 'Death by Video Game'](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/01/07/death-by-video-game-and-inside/)
 	  * [_Firewatch_: A Review](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/02/21/firewatch-review/)
 	  * [_The Witness_: A (Cheater's) Review](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/03/11/the-witness-a-cheaters-review/)

I also played _Uncharted 4_, which I thought to have a profoundly moving story and absolutely stunning visuals. My review, which somehow finds room to discuss _Mega Man 7_ and 2016's atrocious _Warcraft_ film, can be found [here](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/07/30/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-a-review/).

Also of note, _Pokemon Go_ took the world by storm, something unprecedented in video games since the Wii. It may have seemed ambitious to deem it [Game of the Year in July](https://www.zerocounts.net/2016/07/13/pokemon-goty/), but I'll argue that due to its cultural impact, I wasn't wrong.
