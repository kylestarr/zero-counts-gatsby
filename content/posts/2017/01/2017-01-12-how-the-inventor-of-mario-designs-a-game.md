The explainer people at Vox put together a nice [distillation of Shigeru Miyamoto's design philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-NBcP0YUQI):

I imagine this interview was filmed during Miyamoto's monstrous press tour for _Super Mario Run_. Love the inclusion of beautiful animations and archival footage by Vox's team.

For more on the design of World 1-1, watch Dan Emmons' breakdown '[Level 1-1 - How Super Mario Mastered Level Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH2wGpEZVgE)'.

For more about the business side of Nintendo, read '[Console Wars](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062276704/console-wars)' by Blake J. Harris.

For more about his characters and _Super Mario Run_, watch/listen to [Miyamoto's interview with Katie Linendoll at Apple SoHo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/super-mario-run/id1184967541?mt=2).
