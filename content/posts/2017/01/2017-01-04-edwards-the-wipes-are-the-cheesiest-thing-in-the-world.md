Regarding differences between Star Wars story and saga films, I failed to notice the omission of the iconic Star Wars 'wipe' in _Rogue One_.

[_Rogue One_ director Gareth Edwards, in an interview with Empire](http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/rogue-one-13-revelations-director-gareth-edwards/):


<blockquote>4. The famous ‘wipes’ do exist in other cuts

We did have versions of the film [with] wipes, and then it just felt like we were doing it because we could. The wipes are the cheesiest thing in the world. The only time you can ever do it and not be cheesy's in _Star Wars_. There’s part of me that wanted the wipes and things like that, but the film is supposed to be different. We were given a license by the studio to be unique from the others, and we just took that license and ran with it as an excuse to try and be a bit more out there.</blockquote>


While I won't disagree with Edwards, I think "cheesy" is the wrong word. Whimsical, perhaps?
