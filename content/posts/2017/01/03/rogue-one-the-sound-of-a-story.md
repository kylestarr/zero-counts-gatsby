Michael Giacchino (_Lost_, _Star Trek_, _Up_) is the first Star Wars film composer to step foot in John Williams' shadow.

[Giacchino in an interview with Anthony Breznican, Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/article/2016/11/23/rogue-one-composer-michael-giacchino-music-star-wars-standalone/):


<blockquote>**Entertainment Weekly: So you were a late addition to the _Rogue One _crew…**

**Michael Giacchino: **Yes, literally the last thing I expected I’d be doing this month would be this. I mean we were literally planning a vacation when I got the call asking if I could come and talk to them about it. At the time, it left me with _literally_ four and a half weeks to write. So it was one of those decisions where you’re like, okay, well… And I was talking to my brother about it. He goes, “Oh, come on. You’ve been writing this score since you were 10! You can do this.”</blockquote>


Giacchino, the long time J.J. Abrams collaborator, had replaced [Alexandre Desplat](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-rogue-one-replaces-929387) (_Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, _The Grand Budapest Hotel_).


<blockquote>**EW: What inspirations will we hear in the music?**

MG: It does borrow from traditions that both John [Williams] and George Lucas borrowed from when they made the original _Star Wars_, you know. George was looking at _Flash Gordon_, the old serials, and John was looking at [Gustav] Holst and different composers along the way to get a baseline for what he wanted to communicate. There is a wonderful musical language that John put together for the original films. I wanted to honor that vernacular but still do something new with it, something that was still me in a way.</blockquote>


My great friend [Scott Kawai](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3076949/) often makes the case that Michael Giacchino is the next John Williams, with a style heavy of colorful and memorable themes. Without reading too much about _Rogue One_, I assumed he had been the first choice for the film. The revelation that Desplat was the first choice was a shock to me. Desplat's music is certainly incredible with an air of moody atmosphere, but does not strike me as "Star Wars". I'd kill to hear his take on _Rogue One_.

There are inclinings of the saga's legacy in Giacchino's score— curious woodwinds and dancing percussion at the opening of "He's Here For Us"— but there is a drive in the timber that strikes less fantastic and more brooding. It is immediately clear that the "stories" have room for exploration and departure from the "saga". There are ties back to the episodic series, but at their core, Giacchino's pieces are something new and derivative; they are always less memorable, iconic, or sure of themselves. Nonetheless, there are many times when the presence of brass brightens and lifts what is ultimately a grittier film to something more familiar and nostalgic— something more reminiscent of Star Wars.

As for the touches of William's throughout Giacchino's score, The Force Theme is heard when Bail Organa enters the frame. Likewise, The Imperial March is heard during Darth Vader's appearance. During the film's finale, both themes are heard as two iconic characters make stunning (re-)appearances, which can be heard in ["Hope"](https://itun.es/us/b21Ogb?i=1185111630) on the film's soundtrack.

However, the one that struck me the most was the piece backing _Rogue One_'s title card, the finale of ["A Long Ride Ahead"](https://itun.es/us/b21Ogb?i=1185111587) on the soundtrack. Briefly teasing Williams' Main Title sequence, it kicks off the iconic C-G half-notes but branches into something new and less confident.


<blockquote>**Kathleen Kennedy says they’re trying to break from some of the traditional _Star Wars_ tropes, like doing away with the opening crawl. Sounds like that applies to the music as well?**

Kathy said that to me, too — “No one is asking you to do what was done before.” I feel it’s important to be me, but in this universe, we’re working within. That was sort of the challenge. It was never sort of, “Oh, you have to do this, this, and this.” It was always just: “Here are the emotions that we need to cover.”</blockquote>


As a story outside of the saga, Giacchino's freedom is extremely evident, for better or worse. My question is whether or not Giacchino's score will be the audible language of all Star Wars stories to come, or just specifically _Rogue One_? Even more specifically, is _Rogue One_'s title card sequence strictly _Rogue One_'s title theme, or has Giacchino defined the theme for all Star Wars stories?

The other changes—the omission of the opening crawl, lower-left location queues, a lone title card— are so heavy-handed that it leads me to assume the themes Giacchino has established for _Rogue One_ will permeate future Star Wars stories.
