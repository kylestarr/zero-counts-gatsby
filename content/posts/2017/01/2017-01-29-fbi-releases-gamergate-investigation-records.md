[Adi Robertson, The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/27/14412594/fbi-gamergate-harassment-threat-investigation-records-release):


<blockquote>The FBI appears to have made a serious investigation of some threats, but at least one email thread suggests there were breakdowns in communication with the subjects of them. “We feel like we are sending endless emails into the void with you,” complained one sender. Based on the timing and location details, this was Wu, who published [her own account](http://www.themarysue.com/will-prosecutors-act-on-gamergate-death-threat/) of the experience on the same day. Overall, at least one report indicates that centralizing the investigation in San Francisco limited its jurisdiction. It’s also not clear how familiar some of the FBI agents involved were with common internet services. Twitter is sometimes referred to as “Tweeter,” and one email mentions suspects using “Thor” (probably [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)) for security.

Via Twitter, Wu said that the threats the FBI discussed were only a fraction of the ones she sent them, and that the agency was largely unresponsive to her attempts to provide evidence. “All this report does for me is show how little the FBI cared about the investigation,” she told The Verge. “As I remember, we had three meetings with the FBI, we had two meetings with Homeland Security, we had three meetings with federal prosecutors in Boston. Almost nothing we told them is in this report.” She confirmed that the juvenile mentioned above had been making death threats using his father’s phone; he was apparently grounded as punishment.

This report was actually released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request last year, although at that point, it was difficult to verify whether the recipients had modified its contents. Since “Gamergate” was never really an organized movement, none of the people mentioned in the report are “members” of it, and some incidents predate the controversy, like a bomb threat against Anita Sarkeesian at the 2014 Game Developers Conference. But if anything, this emphasizes that Gamergate per se was one facet of a larger culture war — which it’s now been almost completely absorbed into.</blockquote>


I often wonder why it is I'm so fixated on video games and their culture. I initially started writing on the topic to help bridge what I felt was a chasm between "average joes" and "nerds". These were worlds I strattled growing up, often hiding my adoration for video games because I was afraid to be uncool.

Later, after seeing my little brother and cousins take to the medium, I sought to bridge a chasm between parents and video games. I focused my writing on the health and education impacts of video games.

Today, in the midst of American uncertainty and woe, I wonder if thinking about video games anymore than escapism is worthwhile. Certainly, there are bigger things. But then I recall Gamergate; what I see as the first emergence of the "alt-right". As [Ezra Klein refered to it on his podcast episode with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611?mt=2&i=1000378960137), it was another moment of the merging of partisan and ideological identities:


<blockquote>**Ezra Klein**: I thought Gamergate was one of the most interesting things to happen in the last couple of years.

**Ta-Nehisi Coates**: Because _that_ had to do with politics, right? Like, why is this happening?

**EK**: Why did American political sites, Breitbart and Salon, develop an interest in an argument about whether video game sites were unduly influenced by some kind of personal relationship? When you say what happened out loud it sounds ridiculous.

**TC**: It's hard to make it make sense.

**EK**: My big Rosetta Stone in American politics  for the last 20 or 30 years is partisan and ideological identities merged: if you're a Democrat, you're a liberal; if you're a Republican, you're a conservative. That didn't used to be true. Once that happened, it set the stage for all of these other identities to align: where you live, who you marry, what you think about _12 Years a Slave_, what you think about video game fights on the internet. The stronger this sorting mechanism becomes, the more lethal the collisions between it become.</blockquote>


Video games [span a hearty set of demographics](http://essentialfacts.theesa.com). It's a medium that has taken the entertainment industry by storm. And it's a medium that enjoys a massive online community, many players of which partake in anonymity. As ideologies and interests merge, it is important foster an inclusive and understood community, especially a community that encompasses the majority of American households.

It is important to write and talk about video games—even in anonymity (looking at me)—possibly now more than ever. And it goes without saying that a large swath of current day writers, artists, and activists were raised on and are familiar with the medium and likely its communities, let alone Tweeter and Thor.
