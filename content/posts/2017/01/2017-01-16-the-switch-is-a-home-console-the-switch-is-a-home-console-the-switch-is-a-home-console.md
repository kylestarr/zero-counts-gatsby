[Chaim Gartenberg reporting for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/13/14261876/nintendo-switch-specs-32gb-720p-screen-battery-life):


<blockquote>Storage-wise, the Switch includes 32GB of onboard memory, which feels dramatically low in today’s age of 500GB and 1TB Xbox Ones and PS4s, especially with the modern focus on downloadable titles. However, storage can be expanded through the use of microSD cards. Games for the Switch will come on physical GameCards, which may help alleviate the console’s onboard storage space by offloading most of the storage requirements for each game to the individual GameCards.

Lastly, the Switch can connect to the internet through an 802.11ac Wi-Fi connection, with the ability to connect to up to eight Switch consoles at once for local multiplayer. Additionally, the Switch will be able to connect using Ethernet using a USB LAN adaptor with the dock.

I keep needing to remind myself that the [Switch is a "home" console](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/01/14/nintendo-switch-presentation-2017-impressions/) you can take with you. That _is_ the dream.

But the fact that the dock does little outside of charging and video output, not to mention the need for a USB LAN adaptor for an Ethernet connection, begs the question, "can Nintendo keep up with this 'home' console marketing push?"

The Switch is a powerful tablet with novel input devices. Curious to see how many players use it while docked. Also curious to see if developers cater to battery life over fidelity and performance.

_UPDATE_: [Nintendo's UK website now lists the Switch's technical specifications](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch/Specifications/Specifications-1176277.html#1), confirming separate wired LAN adapter:


<blockquote>**Communication features**

Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac compliant) / Bluetooth 4.1 (TV mode only. A wired LAN connection is possible through the use of a commercially available wired LAN adapter.)
