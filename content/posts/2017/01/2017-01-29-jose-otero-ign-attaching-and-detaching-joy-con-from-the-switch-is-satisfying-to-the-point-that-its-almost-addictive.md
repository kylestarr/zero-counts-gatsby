[Jose Otero, IGN, timestamp 3:11](https://youtu.be/IvCQQucF-Ak?t=3m11s):


<blockquote>Outside of the tiny face buttons, the analog sticks, digital triggers, and shoulder buttons feel solid and well made.

The Joy-Con are surprisingly comfortable and versatile in the hand too. And attaching and detaching them from the console is satisfying to the point that it's almost addictive.</blockquote>


I remember feeling satisfaction attaching and detaching Controller and Rumble Paks from the Nintendo 64 controller's expansion port.

I can't wait to get my hands on this thing.
