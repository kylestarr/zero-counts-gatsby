[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14911478/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-has-the-courage-to-assume-youre-not-stupid):


<blockquote>_Breath of the Wild_ feels like a return of the schoolyard culture, where friends meet to discuss the latest things they’ve found in a Nintendo game and share rumors of even bigger possible secrets, except now the schoolyard is _the entirety of the internet_. It’s comfortable with assuming that you’re smart enough to figure things out, and it knows that it’s not going to be ultimately responsible for everything you miss or even built-in frustration. The answer to every puzzle is a quick Google away, and the game’s design seems comfortable with that option being a viable path to moving forward.</blockquote>


I completely agree.

[Hidemaro Fujibayashi, _Breath of the Wild_ Game Director, on designing Breath of the Wild's open gameplay at GDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMsF31NdNc):


<blockquote>Let's not forget the fact that all the solutions to all the puzzles that we've painstakingly prepared for a dungeon are made available on the internet.</blockquote>


Great design decision by Fujibayasha and team. _Breath of the Wild_ is clearly not their first rodeo, but this strikes me as forward thinking for Nintendo.
