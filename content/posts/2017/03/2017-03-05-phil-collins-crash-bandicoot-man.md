A fun tidbit from [Phil Collins' memoir "Not Dead Yet"](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538475/not-dead-yet-by-phil-collins/9781101907474/):


<blockquote>Somewhat dazed, I go back to the hotel, the Peninsula Beverly Hills. Lily, now aged nine, is waiting for me, which brightens things up no end. She and I start playing Spyro the Dragonâ€”computer games are one of our new shared passions. I love them, and I love Spyro, although if push comes to shove, I'll declare myself a Crash Bandicoot man. As if by magic, the hearing in my left ear roars back. It's like I've been underwater, but the blockage is suddenly gone. Thank God for that.</blockquote>
