"Cheriâ€¦! How do you spell 'Sierra?'" a question I would often shout to my step-mother from an adjacent room. Their PC housed a game called _Quest for Glory_. Somewhere between my limited knowledge of MS-DOS and the English language, I would ask and re-ask this question, eventually running the prompt C:\sierra\glory.exe. To add to the naivety, I didn't learn how to intiate mouse control until my dad's friend (and _King's Quest_ junkie) relayed the message to me. For years, I had been playing a point-and-click without, well, a mouse to point and click.

Nonetheless, today is different; though, not entirely far off. I've completed the first chapter of the _King's Quest_ reboot on PS4 without a mouse. And boy, did it feel great.

At heart, I'm a _Quest for Glory_ kid. In any case, my memory serves _King's Quest_ far from simplistic and innocent, but dashed with bits of humor and challenge. That said, the personally and puzzles in the reboot feel more realized and extemely fitting.

_Princess Bride_ notes ring hard and true, from a grandfather's storytelling to a cast including Wallace Shawn (and Christopher Lloyd, not to be left without mention!), but it's all a lovely addition and somewhat apt recalling of the memories of playing the (or those in spirit to the) original game. The humor and trials dance between easy no-brainer to truly challenging exercises of "wit." And while most of the game's writing and development is close to that of a better than average Disney film with clever storytelling devices strewn about, there is one surprising and appreciated moment that brings some weighty emotion; its effect ringing subtly through the remainder of the chapter.

The first of five chapters, A Knight to Remember, resolves with satisfaction. The art direction is gorgeous, animations fluid, and the writing is sure to land a few square chuckles with all age groups. The game comes off as a Disney movie that you play. Not to mention it took much longer than I had expected to complete. While I'm one for concise games these days, it felt appropriate that _King's Quest_ had more to ofter than anticipated. This coming after viewing [a score of 6.5 from one of my favorite game reviewers](http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/28/9035975/kings-quest-review-chapter-1-xbox-one-ps4-pc).

_King's Quest_ is a worthy play and I am eagerly looking forward to the next chapter.
