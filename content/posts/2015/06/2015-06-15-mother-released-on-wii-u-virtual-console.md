Hours ago, Nintendo released the 1989 Japanese title _Mother_ to the Wii U Virtual Console as _[Earthbound: Beginnings](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ttKkiEKqwuk)_, localized in English for the first time ever. Until now, the only exposure to the _Mother _series English audiences have had was 1995's North American release of the critically acclaimed _Mother 2_, released as _Earthbound_.

The Virtual Console was the biggest selling point for the Wii for me, and it continues to be for the Wii U. My latest Wii U purchases include _Super Metroid_, _Donkey Kong 64_, and _Paper Mario_. The release of _Earthbound: Beginnings_ is certainly interesting and a direct message to the hardcore/loyalist/older audience.

Paired with _[Super Smash Bros.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WWM-SCjIuNg)_ and [accidental Amiibo announcements](http://kotaku.com/image-of-new-animal-crossing-mario-maker-amiibo-emerge-1711264261), as well as the reboot of the Nintendo World Championship, Nintendo seems to be drawing a lot of eyes as E3 nears. 

[_EDIT_: After browsing the Nintendo eShop, it appears Wii games are not considered Virtual Console titles. I've removed _Metroid Prime Trilogy_ and _Super Mario Galaxy 2_ from my list of recent Virtual Console purchases. That doesn't change the fact that my most recent purchases have been legacy titles. Thanks to [@AlexandreSitbon](http://www.twitter.com/AlexandreSitbon) for encouraging my research.]
