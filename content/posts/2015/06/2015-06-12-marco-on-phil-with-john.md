On June 9th, 2015, Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, a man who has spent half of his life at Apple Inc., joined Daring Fireball's John Gruber on stage for a live episode of _The Talk Show_.

Here's a bit from [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2015/06/11/live-with-phil):


<blockquote>This meant a lot for both John and podcasting. Apple sent an executive to be interviewed on a podcast, and one of the highlights of John Gruber’s career as a writer didn’t involve writing at all.</blockquote>


To quote Marco further, "I'd listen to [their podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talk-show-with-john-gruber/id528458508?mt=2#episodeGuid=http%3A%2F%2Fdaringfireball.net%2Fthetalkshow%2F2015%2F06%2F09%2Fep-123)." It will be remembered.
