I've been playing a lot more _Mario Kart 8_ lately and recently played through Moo Moo Meadows. My wife loves this course. It is simple and old, recently made beautiful. Maybe it's the lighting, but I get a similar vibe from Moo Moo Meadows as I do Wild Woods. Call me crazy, but I'm doubling down on [the direction of the next 3D Mario](https://www.zerocounts.net/2015/04/26/mario-kart-8-dlc-pack-2-here-we-go/).
