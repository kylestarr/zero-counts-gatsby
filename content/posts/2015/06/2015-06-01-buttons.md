Over the past week or so, I've learned that [you can play _Splatoon_ with two controllers taped together](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-play-splatoon-with-two-controllers-taped-t/1100-6427700/). I've also learned that [_Batman: Arkham Knight_ is a sprawling complicated buffet of gaming genres](http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/28/8672915/batman-arkham-knight-buffet-of-gaming).

While the latter _may_ be less about controls, I'm going to bet a "complicated buffet of gaming genres" would be a whole lot less daunting if I didn't have 17 input methods on my PS4 to use at a moment's notice:



	  * D-pad (up, down, left, right)
	  * Left joystick
	  * Right joystick
	  * Circle
	  * Square
	  * Triangle
	  * X
	  * L1
	  * L2
	  * L3
	  * R1
	  * R2
	  * R3
	  * start
	  * options
	  * clickable touchpad
	  * PS button

After you're done digesting all of that, take a moment to [get to know your Xbox One Wireless Controller](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/xbox-one-wireless-controller).

As Ben Thompson pointed out:

Beyond casuals, this is a problem for returning and often busy players. The fear of returning to a video game after days, weeks, or months of not playing – hell, the fear of picking up any video game to begin with – may stem from the problems above. Tutorials are commonplace in video games. Half the time I forget what the tutorials taught me. But instead of digging through menus for a refresher, I return to button mashing and familiarity for the sake of progress.

I began playing video games with the following inputs:



	  * D-pad
	  * A
	  * B
	  * Select
	  * Start

Today, most people start with less: A touchscreen. Even with an unabashed fondness for the admittedly hideous and complex [Nintendo 64 controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_controller), I've taken to iOS games that require simple gestures and brief touches but offer rich experiences.1 (See: _[Alto's Adventure](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-adventure/id950812012?mt=8)_, _[The Room](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-room/id552039496?mt=8)_, _[Monument Valley](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8)_)

Whether or not _Journey_ can be considered a "game", it is an award-winning experience that only utilized for 44% of the PS3's buttons. While all buttons were used in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, it_ _did something extremely interesting: Auto-jumping. When I first played the game, I thought it crazy that jumping was defined by the world, not the player. But I got used to it and eventually loved it. It made perfect sense. In a physical world of button fatigue, a virtual world helped establish what was critical to player timing and what was trivial based on surroundings.

I've been dipping in and out of _Far Cry 4_ lately. I haven't come across a good instance where _I_ should be the one to define when to grapple or it necessary to control the climb mechanism. (Granted I've only played for a few hours.) Grappling seems trivial. On the flip-side, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ controls my use of potions based on programming, default or player defined. Potion use is trivial. Your character needs to be healed, so the game heals you. The player need not press a button.

I certainly have a reverie for the days of 5 inputs. A colleague and I spent time handling an original Game Boy last week, remembering just how comfortable and satisfying the early handheld felt. (The feels and travel of it's buttons are a thing of beauty.) The more I sit back and think about the backwards oddity of shutting out an extremely large swath of consumers while deterring those who are ripe to purchase but are fatigued and tired of re-learning, the more I picture [grandma's remotes](http://hugelolcdn.com/i700/212551.jpg).
