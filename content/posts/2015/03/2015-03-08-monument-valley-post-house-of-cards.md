[Michael Martin, IGN](http://ign.com/articles/2015/03/08/monument-valley-app-store-success-continues-following-house-of-cards-appearance):



<blockquote>Main character Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is seen playing and describing the game in the fifth episode of the hit Netflix series. As a result, the game has soared into the top 10 top paid apps on [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/paid-apps/), where it currently resides at number five and is number three in the paid games category on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/top/category/GAME?hl=en) store. The game did not rank in the top 25 on either app store before appearing on the show.  
  
Speaking at GDC 2015, ustwo lead designer Ken Wong said the show’s producers reached out to the developer about the game appearing in House of Cards at no cost to the studio, according to [IB Times](http://www.ibtimes.com/monument-valley-became-smash-hit-after-house-cards-boost-frank-underwood-1838318).  
  
“They called us up and they said, ‘Can we use your game?’ and we said ‘Yes,’” Wong said.</blockquote>
