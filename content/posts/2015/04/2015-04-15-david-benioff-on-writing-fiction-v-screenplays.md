[Game of Thrones co-creator David Benioff on Aisha Tyler's Girl On Guy podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/girl-on-guy-179-david-benioff/id452940855?i=339380318&mt=2):


<blockquote>Writing dialogue. I love it. That's the fun part for me. The hard part for me is writing the descriptions. There's just something great about writing 'INT. RESTAURANT. DAY/NIGHT'. A production designer's going to figure that shit out. I don't have to worry about it. I'm just going to write what the characters are saying.

I still love writing novels. Writing fiction to me... I still think of it as the highest form of writing, but it's so fucking hard and it's torture for me. I don't have fun doing it. I have fun writing screenplays.</blockquote>


An extremely honest and reassuring quote. What aspiring writerÂ doesn't want to hear a quote like this from one of the co-creators of the most ambitious show on television?
