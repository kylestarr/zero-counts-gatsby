March 30, 2015 marked the 25th anniversary of the original _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ film. In commemoration, The Hollywood Reporter rounded up several cast and crew members to recount the making of the highest grossing independent film at the time.

[The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-untold-785653):


<blockquote>**Gray:** I always thought it would be interesting to have someone who was coming out of MTV videos to amp this up visually. To make it a little bit younger. Director Steve Barron was suggested to us. We looked at his reel. He had done all this great stuff with A-ha. He had done "Billie Jean" with **Michael Jackson**. He had a very good visual style.


**Steve Barron, director: **I didn't want to do something that was bloody. I didn't want to watch that film. Funnily enough, _Batman_ came out at the same time. It was that sort of tone I was already aiming for. The films that I loved, there was a sense of humor but a sense of peril as well. Of real peril, of grounded peril. Like something that had repercussions for what you did but had a wonderful sense of fun with it. I was a big fan of _Ghostbusters_.

**Eastman**: For an independent film, it was beyond our wildest hopes. We liked the final movie and we hoped people would like it, and [the fact] it did as well as it did was fantastic. Of all the versions of _Turtles_ that have been optioned over the past 30 years now — and certainly in the entertainment arena — the first movie stands out as our hands-down favorite version.</blockquote>


If Barron's _TMNT_ is not my favorite movie, it easily slides into my top 5. [I just wish Street Fighter would have been as successful.](http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/3/10/5451014/street-fighter-the-movie-what-went-wrong)
