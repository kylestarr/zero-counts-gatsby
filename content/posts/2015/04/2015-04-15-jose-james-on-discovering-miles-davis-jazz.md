[American jazz and hip-hop vocalist José James during a 'Meet the Musician' event at the Apple Store, Kurfürstendamm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/jose-james-meet-the-musician/id985843137?mt=2):


<blockquote>I couldn't believe one artist had made 50 albums. I pull one out and I look at the back and it has four tracks on it and each track is 18-minutes long. I'm thinking, "I can't listen to this. I want value." I was looking for the one with twelve tracks on it.</blockquote>


So incredibly peculiar how we subscribe value. I too ran into the same quandary when experiencing Miles Davis for the first time. Then I thought back to listening to "[The Decline](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-decline-single/id291740773)" on repeat. And "[2113](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/2113/id365400149?i=365401921)" after that. And "[Goodbye Sky Harbor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goodbye-sky-harbor/id718997679?i=718998206)" after that. And "[Cicatriz E.S.P.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cicatriz-esp/id1645821?i=1645813)" after that. And "[Drop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/drop/id266185726?i=266188594)" after that. And "[Chimera Obscurant](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/chimera-obscurant/id460516470?i=460516498)" after that. And "[Dauðalagið](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/track-7/id27067?i=27063)" after that.

Cumulative time does not equate to value. I'll be damned if I couldn't listen to "[So What](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/so-what/id268443092?i=268443097)" on loop for the rest of my life.
