[Seth Godin on The Moment with Brian Koppelman](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-moment-seth-godin-10-7-14/id814550071?i=339877000&mt=2):


<blockquote>If you think that you were born to paint in oils, or you were born to speak the truth about income inequality, or you were born— it's just not true. If Vincent Van Gogh were born today, he would not work in oils. If Steve Jobs had been born 500 years ago, he would have done something else.

So what is the authentic version of Vincent Van Gogh? There isn't one. What there is is someone who sought out a series of emotions that he could create for himself and gifts he could give other people through his work. And what I'm getting at is yes, we need to be consistent in honoring the truth of what we came to say.

But I also know that if I'd been born one block away from where I was born to different parents, or if I had been born in Yugoslavia, the fact that I'm here talking to you about these things would not have occurred. This is not the authentic expression of my DNA.</blockquote>


Excellent reminder.
