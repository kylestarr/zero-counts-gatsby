<blockquote>Normally, busting outside of the normal confines of a level in _Mario Kart 8 _requires a) some sort of glitch or bug to be present and exploitable, or b) a hack of the game like the ones two modders [famously performed](http://kotaku.com/the-men-who-hacked-mario-kart-8-1622076182) last year. _Kart _racer and Reddit user [dizzyzane](http://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/34ddqr/well_thats_neat/) wasn’t using any special hacking tricks, though. He was just driving really, really fast thanks to _Mario Kart 8’s _[game-changing new 200CC](http://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-200cc-mode-changes-everything-1699996754) speed class.</blockquote>


Love this. Like that moment when a toddler goofs, turning a harmless accident into a humorous event. Makes you appreciate the calculations behind great level design and game balance. (Though, it appears breaking Music Park's ceiling was already possible in 150CC, just not to this extent, as per [kingdomharms's Reddit reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/34ddqr/well_thats_neat/cqtnk3r).)

_EDIT_: Thinking on it, I'm a bit mixed about 200CC. On one hand, if 200CC is truly a new feature, the fact that more levels were not broken open with the increased speed is a testament to Nintendo as a quality game maker. That is, unless, 200CC was planned from the get go; to which  200CC would have been a business strategy for increased play time / player investment. If that is the case, I'm always miffed at the holding back of content.
