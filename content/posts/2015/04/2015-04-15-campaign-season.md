Over the weekend, I had an interesting conversation with a relative. The conversation was not interesting so much as my reaction was interesting.

This relative asked what school I had gone to and I replied with the addition that I had majored in political science. Without hesitation, he responded, "let's talk about politics." My reply, "let's not," went in one ear and out the other.

To backtrack, I had become extremely passionate about politics during my senior year of high school. Over the course of my college career, I shied away from pursuing my innate passion to debate ethics, policy, and humanitarian issues. However, after many twists-and-turns, majors and minors, I found myself holding a BA in political science.

Back to the conversation.

Naturally, it veered into Hillary Clinton's announcement for the 2016 presidential bid. My relative's qualm against her was that electing her as president "would put Bill back in the White House," but "Bill was a good president." My confusion began here.

Then my blood began to boil. I hadn't felt this way in a long time. But I wouldn't let it get the better of me. I was wiser than I was in high school and college. I had learned not to speak up when I didn't know 110% of what I was talking about.

But I snapped.

After a few unproven assumptions about how things would pan out if she were president, I interrupted:

"If Hillary is elected, there are going to be folks that never let go of the email scandal. If Ted Cruz is elected, there are going to be folks that never let go of the fact that he was born in Canada. Just like the folks that wasted four years plus _another_ four years questioning Obama's birth certificate.

"Too much time is wasted. This shit doesn't matter."

It was quick, tame, and uneducated in the context of all things political. But even without all the answers and a well crafted strategy (of which I only ever had in school), I fought back; something I hadn't done in _years_.

To be clear, I do believe that Hillary's email scandal is a big deal. But under the context of my argument, it helped... maybe. I'm rusty. Cut me some slack.

In any case, the campaign season is upon us. Every four years, many "sports ball" tech nerds like myself get fired up during this time. It is a spectator sport we get interested in. And unlike fantasy sports, selecting your candidates and propositions actually affect real-life.

In the next week or so, my passion around campaign season will likely cool down. Like the baseball season, I'll stay focused during opening week, putter out during mid-season, and ramp back up during the final third. But for once in quite some time, I feel fired up. And I like it.
