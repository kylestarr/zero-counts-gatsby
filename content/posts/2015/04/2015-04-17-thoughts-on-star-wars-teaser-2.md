	  1. I could have sworn they were pulling audio from [Return of the Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDYX_PgorRY). (Mark Hamill still sounds youthful.) Until Luke's line: "You have that power, too."
	  2. And if this is truly new dialogue, Luke state's that his 'father _has_ it." Has. Not had.
	  3. It's fun to imagine Vader is still around, but whether it's clever audio splicing or Luke referring to the omnipresent (Force ghost*) Anakin, I say Vader is dead and gone.
	  4. Finn is a trepidatious Stormtrooper recruit. The chaotic stormtrooper battle scene affirms his worries and he chooses to leave the Empire (or equivalent faction). This is the first time we witness the weight of war and death on soldiers in the post-prequel films.**
	  5. I need to figure out a way to be a part of this upcoming series of Disney Star Wars films.
	  6. I hate zoom. (1:28)

* Thanks for the heads up to [@AlexandreSitbon](https://twitter.com/AlexandreSitbon/status/588908567719182337). The [term](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_ghost) was slipping my mind.
