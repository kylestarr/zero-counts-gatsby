[Mario Kart 8 DLC Pack 2](http://mariokart8.nintendo.com/dlc/) was released on April 23, 2015. The addition of _Animal Crossing's_ Villager and Isabelle as well as Dry Bowser don't do much for me. Likewise, new karts have never been something I glamour for, often selecting the standard kart for every race. (I dig classic!) However, the new _Crossing_ and _Bell_ cups include some of the most gorgeous video game visuals I have come across, Nintendo game or otherwise.

As I was racing through the new and original _Wild Woods_ track, I was itching for Dry Bowser to hop out of his kart and explore. (I've experienced similar feelings racing through _Shy Guy Falls_, _Dolphin Shoals_, and _Toad Harbor_.) Likewise, the _Animal Crossing_ track turns the traditionally isometric town into a truly inhabitable world.

A racing game feeling inhabitable speaks volumes.

A breathtaking "open-world" _Legend of Zelda_ is a reality. Likewise, Nintendo has shown stellar execution of HD visuals in _Mario Kart 8_. This adds up to trigger a craving for the next iteration of 3D Mario games to be set in a seamless HD universe; freeing itself from stage selection and selective star quests and instead opting in for a connected Mushroom Kingdom.

This does not mean an "open-world" Mario game. I am no champion for open-world games. In fact, I often loathe them. I become distracted by side-quests and/or feel forced spend hours completing unnecessary tasks to progress the story or grow the game only to be forced to backtrack or fast-travel to previously completed areas. More and more I feel "open-world" means "lock-in", encouraging players to invest obscene amounts of time in a single game to the point where they are afraid or ashamed to give it up.

I would love to see the next iteration of 3D Mario games open up into semi-open, adventure style platformers à la _Jak and Daxter_. No overworld. No stage select. No "painting portals". Missions are discovered throughout the Mushroom Kingdom in lands akin to _Thwomp Ruins_, _Cheep Cheep Beach_, and _Moo Moo Meadows_, each gated by the traditional "star-requirement".

I previously posted some thoughts on [Iterative vs. Redesigned Experiences](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/11/22/iterative-vs-redesign/):


<blockquote>_Super Mario 64_ could have just as easily been another side-scroller, albeit with better visuals. _The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time_ could have been another top-down adventure. _Donkey Kong 64_ could have gone a number of pre-existing directions. Sure the Metroid series skipped the Nintendo 64 generation but _Metroid Prime_ could have been another 2D platformer. The fact of the matter is that these titles reinvented their respective franchises. The worlds and characters we loved were shown in a new light and perspective. Sure, they are great games but they reinvented the way we thought about the franchises. This is what makes them so special.</blockquote>


More than just a great racing game, I believe _Mario Kart 8_ provides a glimpse at the future of the Mushroom Kingdom. Like _Super Mario 64_ dropped the "3D game design" mic, a fully connected Mushroom Kingdom could bring the 3D adventure-platformer back into the limelight and showcase exactly how it should have been done 15+ years ago.
