[Ben Kuchera in an accompanying piece on Polygon, emphasis my own](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7865937/video-games-are-too-damned-long):


<blockquote>People like to say that games are getting shorter, and this is a bad thing, but the data doesn't support that view of the industry. A shorter game can be made for _less money_ which leads to _lower prices_ which means _more people buy it_ ... and so on. But it's also tricky to assume you know what other people want out of their games. _Maybe they want to buy one or two games a year_ that will last nearly forever. In that situation, long games are the best.</blockquote>


[My comment originally posted on said accompanying Polygon article, edited](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7865937/video-games-are-too-damned-long#284837334):


<blockquote>How does game length affect game sales of other publishers? I have yet to purchase _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ because I haven’t yet completed _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_. Developers and publishers _must_ see a hit in sales due to the fact that their potential audience is still wrapped up in a competitor’s (would you consider them competitors?) product.

I’d certainly love to experience more games that developers pour their souls into, I just don’t have the time. And when I’m spending $40-60 on a game, you can bet I want to finish it.</blockquote>


Game length must certainly cut into competing game sales. I'd love to see some investigation into this topic.

Need to know:



	  * What is the market size? (Total video game consumers? How many of those own PS4/Xbox One/both?)
	  * How many consumers eligible to purchase both _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_ and _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ purchased both/one of these titles?
	  * How many consumers are interested in both titles? (Past data might include consumers who purchased both a Batman: Arkham title and Mass Effect/Dragon Age title)
	  * How many purchasers completed one/both title(s)?
