[An official (and of course beautiful) chart](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/527b69fbe4b0febeee4fc9f7/t/54b80483e4b0f32f8253d06c/1421345934518/?format=1000w) of sales figures, analytics, and other interesting stats from ustwogames. My favorites:



	  * $5,858,625 revenue
	  * 50% of players who started the game completed it
	  * 53% of time and 64% of dollars were put into _Forgotten Shores_, the optional DLC expansion, compared against the main title.

Monument Valley is a truly remarkable game. Relinking my review of [Monument Valley 1.0](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/04/06/monument-valley-a-review/) and [Neil McFarland's thoughts on Freemium vs. Premium](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/27/freemium-v-premium/).
