Jim Guthrie has composed incredible soundtracks for the iOS classic [_Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP_](http://www.swordandsworcery.com) and documentary [_Indie Game: The Movie_](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com). For _One of These Days I'll Get It Right_, Guthrie teamed up with producer Solid Mas to release a throwback hip-hop remix record of his work from both soundtracks. It is chock-full of themed movie quotes, turn-table scratches, and an insidious vibe. The most notable record in recent history I can compare it to is [RJD2's _Deadringer_](https://itun.es/us/37W-t).

_One of These Days I'll Get It Right_ is a brilliant album that is much more than just a collection of simple remixes. Like LEGOs, Guthrie and Solid Mas have torn down completed sets and reimagined them as something wholly original. A worthy purchase if you are a fan of Guthrie, hip-hop, film, or a sound from yesteryear.
