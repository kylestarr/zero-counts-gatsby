[Smooth McGroove on the Upvoted Podcast, timestamp 17:45](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-2-story-u-smoothmcgroove/id954162809?i=333614578&mt=2):


<blockquote>It's such a niche thing that I had going, and still do. Not a lot of people played these video games, especially in Oklahoma. Most people that I'd encountered had heard of Zelda and maybe played a Mario game or something like that. Whenever it came to the people that I encountered day-to-day, most people would have never been supportive of this. They would have just said, "Oh, that's a fun thing but keep your day job." It was really the feedback that I got back from the Internet that gave me enough confidence and willpower to reinforce my own drive to do this.

It was April of 2013. I quit giving [drum] lessons, I finished up my last semester at college, and from then on it was a good year-and-a-half straight of just singing, recording, mixing.</blockquote>


On fans:


<blockquote>The fact that they were willing to not only watch a video or listen to a song but make a comment under the YouTube video or buy a song from one of the places I license with. It was when I started a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SmoothMcGroove) that they were willing to donate a dollar for every video I put out.

All of these things coming together was huge for me. It felt so big. It felt like... I can't even describe it really. It was that feeling that allowed me and gave me the confidence to squash not only the doubts, but to push forward the stuff that I really wanted to do, which was make music in some form, some way. It just happened to be through this video game music platform with me singing all the instruments.</blockquote>


Upvoted is the newly debuted podcast from Reddit. Every episode is hopeful and inspiring, especially for silly dreamers.
