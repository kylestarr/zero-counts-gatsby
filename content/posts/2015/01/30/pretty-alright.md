Ben C, a friend of mine, shared his band's new demo with me. I was incredibly impressed. A strong influence from Band of Horses with Grizzly Bear and My Morning Jacket sprinkled about. I especially enjoy "Even When You Don't Sing".

On a personal level, Pretty Alright sounds like a combination of [Alexander J. Roberts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/stay-hungry-stay-foolish/id313454594), [Team Hate Nelson](https://soundcloud.com/altamont-archives/sets/team-hate-nelson), and [Of The Swaying Sort](https://soundcloud.com/altamont-archives/sets/of-the-swaying-sort). Give it a listen.
