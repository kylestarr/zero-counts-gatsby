<blockquote>I have a pretty apathetic stance when it comes to McDonald’s — I don’t love it, but I certainly don’t hate it the way some McDonald’s-shamers do. But I recently got a new job with an office within walking distance of a McDonald’s. And since I generally don’t care about what I put in my body when I’m in the middle of a work day, I gave it a try. On the outside, it looked like a perfectly normal McDonald’s — in fact, even a little boring, as it’s attached to a run-of-the-mill corporate office building. But when I walked inside, my jaw hit the floor.  The restaurant had all these bizarre statues on display in the eating area. And I mean BIZARRE.</blockquote>


Possibly the most hilarious/terrifying thing you'll see today.
