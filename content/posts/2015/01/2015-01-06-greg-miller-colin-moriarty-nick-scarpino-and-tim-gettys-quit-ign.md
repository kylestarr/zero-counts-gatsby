[Kinda Funny Games Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnygames):


<blockquote>In September, you changed our lives. We launched a [Patreon for Kinda Funny](http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny), and your response was beyond (BEYOND!) our wildest expectations. The support, the Tweets, the shares -- it all showed that we really had built the community of best friends we’re always talking about. And, once we knew that, all we wanted to do was make more content for you.

Enter [Kinda Funny Games](http://www.youtube.com/kindafunnygames). Now that we don’t work for IGN, we can talk about the stuff you’ve always wanted us to talk about on YouTube -- games.</blockquote>


I was initially taken aback by this news. Four iconic personalities leaving IGN?! There must be bad blood. I was wrong. After 3+ decades of experience at one of the leading video game publications, backed by 1755 patrons at the time of this publication, and a deep desire to speak their mind at any given time, these guys are braving the unknown and entering into an excited new era of media.

I thoroughly enjoyed Keza MacDonald of Kotaku UK's (ex-IGN) thoughts on the news:


<blockquote>What all this proves is a) god dammit, journalists and media personalities ARE worth money, and b) you can be funded by 5% of your audience

— Keza MacDonald (@kezamacdonald) [January 5, 2015](https://twitter.com/kezamacdonald/status/552157076747980800)</blockquote>


This reminded me of [some thoughts I posted in June 2014](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/17/personality/), derived from Griffin McElroy's interview with [The Indoor Kids](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/indoor-kids-kumail-nanjiani/id450637314):


<blockquote>Baseball diehards can tell you the subtleties in team dynamics. There can be diversity under the same umbrella. Many more sites need to embrace the privilege of instant and educated opinion. If the games community cannot foster intelligent conversation on its own, someone must lead the way.</blockquote>


As an employee of a large tech firm, I deeply understand the desire to freely speak about the industry you are a part of and the prohibitions instated. The benefit Kinda Funny Games has over other would-be media personalities is an established fanbase; however, that makes it no easier to cast aside benefits, workplace friendships, and security.

While I can't say I am a fan of their humor, I do enjoy their critique of video games. Godspeed, Miller, Moriarty, Scarpino, and Gettys.
