During today's Windows 10 event, head of Xbox division and Microsoft Studios Phil Spencer was unabashedly sporting a _Battletoads_ t-shirt. [Polygon followed up](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7867485/battletoads):


<blockquote>When asked, Spencer told Polygon, "I don't think I've ever worn a t-shirt that's been a complete head fake. I don't think I have ... have I? I wouldn't do that." So if it's not a "head fake," we'll consider it a confirmation of more Battletoads.</blockquote>


Rare games could be system sellers in my book. Relinking to last year's post, _[Xbox One: Swinging for the Franchise Fences with Rare IP?](https://www.zerocounts.net/2013/05/22/xbox-one-swinging-for-the-franchise-fences-with-rare-ip/)_
