[Dan Stapleton, IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/10/opinion-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-are-effectively-online-only-consoles):


<blockquote>When Microsoft announced the Xbox One in 2013, it was [going to require an always-on internet connection](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/06/microsoft-details-xbox-one-used-games-always-online) to function. After backlash from gamers and Sony’s gloating proclamation that the PlayStation 4 would play games just fine without the help of the internet, [Microsoft backed down](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/21/xbox-one-doesnt-require-internet-connection) and dropped the requirement (except for a one-time console activation). As it turns out, Microsoft’s initial approach was more realistic about the modern reality of how games are made, and what’s effectively required in order to have a reasonably stable experience with a physical copy of a game you buy off the shelf today. Your console will indeed run without a connection, but your disc-based games may not give it much to work with.</blockquote>


This piece started and ended exactly how I wanted it to; picking up with Microsoft's original (and much maligned) "always-on" strategy, and ending with today's "always-on" gaming reality.

Ben Kuchera recently spoke with former AAA developer Keith Fuller for [this tragicomic piece](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/6/7501619/buggy-games-why-they-happen) on the instability of recent AAA titles. In short:


<blockquote>This sort of thing is more common than you think, and it leads to muddled, unfinished and often buggy releases. It's not a matter of including the kitchen sink; developers are sometimes tasked with adding a hot tub at the last second as the project develops.</blockquote>


Stapleton touches on the fact that patches are blessing, but I seem to remember a time when there weren't even a reality. Maybe I'm showing nostalgic naivety, but I'm having a _very_ difficult time recalling game-breaking bugs from the pre-PS3/Xbox 360 era. But can today's AAA, reality-verging games truly exist in a non-patchable world?

Games are more complex than they have ever been. The benefits of more powerful hardware are simply enablers. In 30+ years, we have moved from simple sketches of fantasy to unparalleled productions that now challenge reality. Global resources are required to make today's video games. That doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the time and resources it takes to generate cutting-edge animations and textures in highly detailed main characters, let alone randomly generated NPCs. I _imagine_ it's easier to create windblown hair now than five years ago, but nothing compared to the two frames it took in [1988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3UiC-kkjc). Just because a console "can" doesn't make it any easier create.

As an aside, allow this 2011 piece from Gamesradar entertain you: [how I wish](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/06/10/microsoft-at-e3/) Microsoft would have stuck with their original strategy.
