During [episode 30](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-030-xiaomi/id826420969?i=330770407&mt=2) of the excellent Exponent podcast, Ben Thompson and James Allworth spin off into a fantastic bit about patents, copyright, and innovation. Allworth's polarizing take should whet your appetite:


<blockquote>Copying each other doesn't blunt innovation; It spurs innovation.</blockquote>


During a chance encounter at the 2002 Warped Tour, Geoff Rickly of Thursday offered me a single piece of advice: Never be afraid to steal. It certainly runs in-line with quotes such as "Good artists copy; Great artists steal," and "That great poets imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil." At the time, Rickly was an idol of mine. His words struck deep.

[As previously mentioned](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/12/30/2014-zero-counts-launch-greatest-hits/), Zero Counts was inspired from [episode 105 of The Talk Show with John Gruber](https://www.zerocounts.net/2015/01/01/jason-snell-on-solo-blogging-stresses/), I completely redesigned Zero Counts with my first practical foray into HTML, CSS, and PHP. ([Archive.org capture from 12/18/14](https://www.zerocounts.net/).) In less than one years time, my writing, design, and coding skills have vastly improved, all thanks to copying Daring Fireball.
