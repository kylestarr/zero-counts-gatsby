Here's a great bit about the anxieties of being a new, lone blogger from [Jason Snell on _The Talk Show with John Gruber_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talk-show-with-john-gruber/id528458508?mt=2&i=328635831), time stamp 1:18:50 - 1:32:45:



<blockquote>Being a one person operation, if you're busy writing a deep-think-piece about something that's going to go on for a thousand words, you're not writing things to post to the site today. I feel like, with a less established site like mine, I definitely feel pressure to keep the lights on every day and try to balance those things. You have a different pace. You can post some links and then you put out a bigger piece every so often.

I like your pace but I don't feel like I can do that right now. I feel like I need to keep the heartbeat a little stronger because I'm trying to establish myself and pick up an audience I may not have captured yet.

The review of the Retina iMac was an example. It took me two or three days to write that. One of my challenges was always should I keep writing this now, or should I stop and find something short to write and post to the site just to let people know I'm still alive while I'm also writing this longer piece. Trying to find that balance is tricky.

Again, not being on a team anymore, and being just myself, I've learned the powerful lesson of how little one person is capable of producing versus a staff.</blockquote>



Snell, formerly of _Macworld_, launched the fantastic [Six Colors](http://sixcolors.com) blog in 2014.
