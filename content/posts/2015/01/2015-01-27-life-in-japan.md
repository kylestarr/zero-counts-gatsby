[Matt Leone, Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/a/life-in-japan):


<blockquote>When we launched [Polygon's cover stories](http://www.polygon.com/forums/meta/2014/10/27/7079023/introducing-polygon-cover-stories) last year, I wrote that one of our goals was to do something different each month. One month could be a behind-the-scenes story on a AAA game, like we did with [Call of Duty](http://www.polygon.com/a/call-of-duty-cover). Another could be a feature about the fall of a company, like we did with [THQ](http://www.polygon.com/covers/2014/12/9/7257209/the-fall-of-thq). And this month, we're trying something else — instead of posting one feature, we put together an online magazine about Japan's game industry.</blockquote>


I'm just now dipping into this collection. 17 stories, gorgeous cover art, and a jukebox; a brilliant take on the digital magazine. The effort and resources Vox Media puts behind their editorial continues to amaze and inspire. Really looking forward to experiencing all this has to offer.
