[Bridging the Generation Gap: Porting Games to New Platforms](http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/11/30/9790028/video-game-ports-remasters-the-last-of-us) by Tom Bennet of Polygon.

From remasters to down-ports to cross-platform development, this is a brilliant introduction to the world of video game porting. [Audio version read by Dave Tach via Polygon Longform podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/polygon-longform/id1035491321?mt=2&i=358078140).

Separate from porting, I am ever intrigued by the following:


<blockquote>Commentators have also levelled criticism at the arguably destructive nature of certain re-releases. These titles exist on a spectrum; to use film as an example, there is an obvious difference between Criterion’s restoration work and LucasFilm’s treatment of the Star Wars films.

Cifaldi argues that true remasters — distinct from remakes or reinterpretations — respect the original artistic intent. "If we’re talking about The Last of Us Remastered, we’re talking about 3D assets," says Cifaldi. "You’re actually going to the original source elements and presenting them in an even cleaner way than before. And I would argue that that is a totally valid approach for that kind of game; it is the equivalent of putting [Star Trek:] The Next Generation on Blu-ray." [Edit: This paragraph originally omitted the Star Trek reference from Cifaldi’s quote.]</blockquote>


Is there any legitimacy in stating 2D animation is more evergreen than 3D? Are 8 and 16-bit sprites poorer quality 2D animations, or are do they stand in a class all their own? Are there any instances of 3D animation that stand the test of time?

I can look at Mario's first primitive 8-bit version without any cringing. Mario's 64-bit likeness on the other hand is rough on the eyes. In the world of cinema, there is no batting an eye to any classic hand-drawn animation. But even with today's advances CG characters and worlds thread a fine-line between believable and terrible.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is is 2D definitive?
