[Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/1/9827700/kings-quest-chapter-2-release-date-rubble-without-a-cause-trailer):


<blockquote>_[King's Quest: Rubble Without a Cause](http://www.polygon.com/game/kings-quest-chapter-two/38804)_, the second of five chapters in The Odd Gentlemen's _King's Quest_, will begin rolling out in two weeks, publisher Sierra announced today.

The episode will be available Dec. 15 on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in North America. It will launch the following day on Windows PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox 360, and in the rest of the world on PS3 and PS4.

The Odd Gentlemen is also changing up the way _King's Quest_ plays from chapter to chapter. Korba told Polygon that while _A Knight to Remember_ was based on the open puzzle-solving structure of the first two King's Quest games, _Rubble Without a Cause_ is "more inspired by [_King's Quest 3: To Heir is Human_]. It's a bit darker and centers on an escape mechanic." The Odd Gentlemen also added the ability to skip dialogue.</blockquote>


Interesting to hear that the gameplay style will change between episodes. The continued homages to the original titles are a nice touch.
