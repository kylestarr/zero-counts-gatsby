[Developer State of Play](http://www.luminocitygame.com/about.html):


<blockquote>Lumino City has been created in a unique way. Everything you see on screen was made using paper, cardboard and glue, culminating in the building of a 10 foot high model city. Laser cutting was used to create finely detailed environment, and miniature lights and motors were built in to bring it to life.</blockquote>


This game is truly a work of art. Not to mention the captivating execution of story just moments in.

"Winner of numerous international awards including the BAFTA for Artistic Achievememtâ€¦" For some reason, regrettably, I held out on playing the Mac version. Happy to have this in my pocket. Looks stunning on iPhone 6s.

[Lumino City is now available for iOS](https://appsto.re/us/MtYi5.i).
