[The New York Times](https://apple.news/AI02irS_IS-y_WSYKKxq3pQ):


<blockquote>Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers has decided to retire after this season.

The 37-year-old Bryant made the announcement in a post on The Players' Tribune on Sunday. The decision was not totally unexpected, given that Bryant has said many times in recent weeks that he was considering making his 20th NBA season his last.

There's no more wondering now.</blockquote>


A thank you and best of luck to Bryant. I've got a rookie card and autographed basketball somewhere.

At the time of this post, "Dear Basketball" is throwing a 503. Regardless, I'm utterly impressed by the pull the The Players' Tribune has managed.

Also, no link to the original post from NYT? Weird.
