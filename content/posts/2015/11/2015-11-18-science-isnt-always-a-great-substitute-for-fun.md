[Justin McElroy, in a short and sweet dual-review with Dave Tach at Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/16/9747556/star-wars-battlefront-review-xbox-one-playstation-4-PC):


<blockquote>For example: New weapons and items unlock at what feels like a glacially slow pace, but that forced me to focus on becoming competent with the items I had on hand and genuinely improving. Compare that to Call of Duty, where I tend to flit between the shiny objects I seem to unlock after every round and never really live with one long enough to become deadly. For a casual fan like myself, that's a big plus.

Admittedly, that slow pace (along with the lack of weapon customization) left me without the compulsive burning desire to play "just one more game" only to see what new trinket was right around the corner. It's an impulse that games like Call of Duty and _Destiny_ have down to a science, but science isn't always a great substitute for fun.

I want to play more _Battlefront_ because it's just that: It's fun.</blockquote>


I vividly recall spending hours with the original _Star Wars: Battlefront_ for PS2. An hours more with _Star Wars: Battlefront II_. They were unlike any shooter I had ever played. And surprisingly for a licensed game, they were fun.

Back to the piece. Dave Tach:


<blockquote>With the notable exception of Boba Fett (and even he has a bizarre and unwieldy control scheme), I have much more fun as an anonymous Rebel or Stormtrooper. Their modes are much more interesting than the movie hero power trip.</blockquote>


I recall feeling initially jarred when diving into the original. I had come in with the expectation that I'd be questing as one of the franchises heroes, and it turned out to be my first experience of the Star Wars universe outside of the perspective of said heroes. I quickly became fond running missions in anonymity. I had an avatar in the Star Wars universe with no preconceived story arc. In turn, anonymity only amplified my desire to continue playing.

I've been looking forward to the _Star Wars: Battlefront_ reboot for a long while now.
