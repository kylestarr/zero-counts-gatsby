[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/target-online-sales-break-record-2015-11) (via [My Nintendo News](http://mynintendonews.com/2015/11/27/target-says-wii-u-was-one-of-the-top-sellers-on-thanksgiving/)):


<blockquote>Target had its biggest online shopping day ever on Thanksgiving.

"Demand outpaced 2014’s record Thanksgiving performance, making it Target’s biggest day for online sales yet," the retailer said in a release.

The record-breaking sales online were driven by three items: the Apple iPad, Apple Watch, and Wii U gaming console, the company said.</blockquote>
