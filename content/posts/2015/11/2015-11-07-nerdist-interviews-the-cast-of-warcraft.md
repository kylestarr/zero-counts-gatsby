[Nerdist nabbed an answer](http://nerdist.com/warcraft-cast-spills-about-the-new-trailer/) to a question in my previous post. It's Garona.

From [WoWWiki](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Garona_Halforcen):


<blockquote>Garona Halforcen is a half-orc half-draenei quest giver for the Horde in the Twilight Highlands. Like most others, she believed she was half-human until the truth was revealed to her. She is an assassin and a spymistress.</blockquote>


From the Nerdist interview, it appears Garona is half-orc half-human, which,_ _in the visual language of the Warcraft Movie, seems to justify her unanimated self. I don't think it works and still lends itself to an awkward visual balance.

Daniel Wu, playing the part of Gul'dan:


<blockquote>If they don't seem real, it's going to be hard as an audience to get into the character. But they are very real. And they are very compelling as CG characters. Like two minutes into the film, you forget that they're actually CG characters.</blockquote>


They don't seem real. However, I said the same of _Avatar_. And after a few minutes into that film, I was onboard.
