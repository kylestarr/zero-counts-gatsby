News of a _Warcraft_ movie with the involvement of Duncan Jones and Legendary Pictures has had me excited for years now. Unfortunately, this trailer does not.

I've eagerly awaited every Blizzard in-house cinematic since _Starcraft's_ in 1998. (If I recall correctly, it shipped on the _Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal_ disc.) I don't believe Blizzard's in-house cinematic team had much to do with this film. And if true, that is a sad fact.

In the games, the orcs' robust physique is met with nearly as robust human physique. Blizzard's own in-house cinematics reflect this as well:

Physique aside, the use of real actors against what appears to be a solely computer-generated backdrop and animated rivals is jarring. (See also the _Star Wars_ prequel trilogy and _The Hobbit_) I thought we were working passed this. I thought the gag of cartoons working in Hollywood was in the process of being shuddered. Confused about how real actors would look in either the orc or human role, I figured they'd both be bolstered by CGI. I figured wrong. On the upside, the close-ups of the orcs look great.

I'm not a World of Warcraft player, but within an hour or so of the Warcraft Movie trailer premier, a cinematic trailer for _World of Warcraft: Legion_, the upcoming WoW expansion was released. This is the kind of visual consistency I was hoping for:

All I'm saying is the unbelievable visual inconsistency of animated characters and backdrops alongside real actors is tired. Give me real _or_ fake. If both, let's stick to the _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ and _Space Jam _gags.
