[Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/12/9724656/star-wars-battlefront-reviews-ea-access):


<blockquote>Review events are a reality of the industry, and in the case of multiplayer-oriented titles, they make sense — it's very difficult to organize 20-40 people in different locations remotely at the same time, and we [introduced provisional reviews this year](http://www.polygon.com/pages/introducing-provisional-reviews) to account for server uncertainty. We've attended review events this year when it made sense to do so, including events for _Call of Duty: Black Ops 3_, _Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain_ and even _Battlefield Hardline_.

But we will not participate in review events that tie our hands in ways that restrict us well after the general public has full access to the game in question. With that in mind, we'll be playing the full version of _Star Wars Battlefront_ on EA Access this week, along with many of you, without support from EA. As we have not agreed to any advance access or accepted any coverage restrictions, our provisional review will be live once we are confident in the opinions of our pair of reviewers.</blockquote>
