[Ludwig Kietzmann, Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2015/02/03/there-is-no-end/):


<blockquote>How can you envision an end when your purpose is to be in motion, always? Where do you stop if what you make, write and think is inextricable from the moment? We poured a bit of our heart and humor into each little vessel – a news story, an opinion, a review – paraded it for thirty minutes and then watched it fall off the page to make room for the next one. And the next. And the next. There is no end.

I just compared blog posts to heart vessels, by the way, and you should know how irritated I am by that. It's just reporting. It's just video games. It's just ... what we did.</blockquote>
