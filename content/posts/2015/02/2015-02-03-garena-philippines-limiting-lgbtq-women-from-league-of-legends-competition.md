[Garena Esports (empahsis my own)](http://esports.garena.ph/newsArticle.php?contentid=00000600&cat=NEWS&subcat=LEAGUE+OF+LEGENDS):


<blockquote>For any events we do, we always want to make sure we are able to have an inclusive environment where no one feels left out, and of course for everybody to enjoy.  On this angle, we believed that allowing more to be eligible to join is obviously the answer and as many of our female teams have expressed -- _Lesbian, Gay, Transgendered Women_ members are their friends too.  On the other hand, for any competitions, we seriously look at ensuring there's a fair level playing field for all participants.  And there are arguments and concerns from other participants who disputes that _Lesbian, Gay, Transgendered Women_ members **may probably have** some unfair advantage.</blockquote>


I have zero tolerance for the twisted logic/suspicion/assumption that one's physical traits, let alone sexual orientation, "may probably" provide them "some unfair advantage" in a competition based purely on mental prowess. Unbelievable.
