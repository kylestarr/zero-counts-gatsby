[The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/02/06/legend-of-zelda-netflix-series/):


<blockquote>The video streaming service is in the early stages of developing a live action series based on “Zelda,” about an ordinary boy named Link who must rescue a princess named Zelda and save a fantasy world called Hyrule, said a person familiar with the matter. As it seeks writers to work on the show, Netflix is describing it as **“[Game of Thrones](http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/tag/game-of-thrones/)”** for a family audience, this person said.

...

As it is still seeking a writer to work on the series, Netflix has a long road to travel before a “Legend of Zelda” series actually becomes a reality. It’s also possible that Netflix or Nintendo will kill the project before it gets off the ground.</blockquote>


Considering Netflix's vision without a writer, I'd say this has a _very_ long road to travel.
