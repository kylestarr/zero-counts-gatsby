Continuing my research of video game genre and protagonist/main character gender, here is the collected data from E3 2014. The sample list of 152 video games was sourced from IGN's [Games at E3 2014](http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Games_at_E3_2014), platform data mapped to a quantifiable “TRUE”/”FALSE” list, genre lists collected from both IGN and Wikipedia (limited to primary genre), and the main character gender researched to the best of my ability.

Elaborating on the gender categories:

“Multi” being either:
- multiple characters to select from (ie. _Mario Kart 8_ / _Killer Instinct_ receive 1 count for “multi” although there are several characters to select from)
- customizable gender
- large customizable party

“n/a” being a:
- gender ambiguous character
- god-view game
- first-person with no direct gender association
