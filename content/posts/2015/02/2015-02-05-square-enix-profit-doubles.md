<blockquote>In the home console space, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 ReMIX sold well, and catalog sales were also "strong," Square Enix said. Meanwhile, the publisher added that Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Quest X are "making favorable progress."</blockquote>



Unrelated: _Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD ReMIX_ is what prompted me to sell my PS3.

To my surprise, an Amazon shipment notice informed me that the game was on its way. The pre-order had slipped my mind as I had placed it nearly a year prior. I was already on the cusp of pulling the trigger on a PS4 when [this IGN bit](http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/first-kingdom-hearts-games-could-still-hit-ps4-and-xbox-one) put me over the edge. I stuffed my unopened _Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD ReMIX_ back into the post, traded-in my PS3 and Xbox 360, and picked up a PS4.

I have no doubt that these games will end up on PS4. Worst case, another reason to subscribe to _Playstation Now_.
