One of my all-time favorite games has been re-released on Steam, iOS, and Android. I spent countless hours with _Heroes of Might & Magic III_ growing up, and during my late-twenties nostalgia trip, had been itching to play again. [The HD sheen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SoRwAHMQ-Y) doesn't do much more than make the game look like what I remember playing, but I'm thrilled they kept the jagged animations around.
