[Club Nintendo](https://club.nintendo.com):


<blockquote>We're experiencing heavy traffic at the moment, so accessing your account may take a little longer than usual and you may see display issues with your account when logged in. Please note that you'll have until 6/30/15 to redeem your rewards. Thank you for your patience.</blockquote>


[Yesterday, Club Nintendo announced a massive sale](https://club.nintendo.com/rewards.do) in conjunction with the discontinuation of the loyalty program, offering physical goods as well as Wii U, Wii, and 3DS downloadable titles at discounted redemption rates. I have since experienced issues a) accessing the page or b) signing in.

[In May 2014, Club Nintendo experienced similar server strain](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/05/31/club-nintendo-stuck-in-mario-kart-traffic/) due to heavy traffic generated by the _Mario Kart 8_ free game offer.
