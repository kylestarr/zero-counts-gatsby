[Stephen Totilo on his excellent Game File newsletter (paywalled)](https://www.gamefile.news/p/arranger-netflix-switch-furniture-mattress):

> I might have the games-movies-TV comparison on my mind because of Arranger’s Netflix connection.
> 
> The new game is available on Switch and PlayStation for a price, but is [also offered on mobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arranger-netflix/id6450325217) at no added cost to anyone with a Netflix subscription. 
> 
> It’s one of many excellent games offered via Netflix on mobile (see also: Kentucky Route Zero, Oxenfree, Poinpy, The Case of the Golden Idol, Storyteller, Immortality, Into the Breach [and more](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/games#games)). 
> 
> But it’s not quite the kind of game that [Netflix execs were hyping to investors](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/18/netflix-nflx-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/) last week as they made clear they’re still bullish on being a big player in gaming. They kept focusing on games that spin off of Netflix shows, and salivated over how a tie-in game can let Netflix “take a show and give the super fan a place to be in between seasons.” That’s the kind of synergy talk that investors like. It makes sense the way it makes sense to extend a brand by selling official t-shirts and coffee mugs. It might even result in some delightful games tied to TV shows.
> 
> It’s just not what Arranger is.
> 
> Arranger is something only possible in games that only needs to be a game and have nothing to do with anything else.

My wife and I resubscribed to Netflix the night before the above newsletter went out (July 26, 2024 — I’m a bit late to posting this). She’s been wanting to watch *Live to 100* and is excited about the upcoming *Emily in Paris* season.

After starting our new Netflix subscription, the first thing I saw when launching the app was a row of mobile games, leading with *Arranger*. I had no intention of playing anything that night, but had heard a lot of good buzz about *Arranger*, so I launched it not 30 seconds after becoming a subscriber.

Then I had an epiphany: Netflix feels like the new Blockbuster.

Blockbuster is most fondly remembered as a movie rental store — truly, Netflix/streaming has been seen as the new Blockbuster for decades — but after seeing Netflix’s programming layout of movies/TV **and** games, I was teleported back to browsing the shelves of Blockbuster on a Friday night — my parents looking for movies while I looked for video games.

Movies/TV and games are complementary — the former is passive and latter is participatory. This often comes up on my podcast [Y-Button](https://www.ybutton.online). As a child, it was such a treat to browse both movies/TV and games under one roof, asking, “What am I in the mood for tonight?” I doubt Netflix is looking to Blockbuster as a model. And it’s not to say one can’t experience any piece of media or medium at any given time on their smartphone, or movies/TV and games on their console. But one curated location (the Netflix app) offering two types of experiences feels right.
