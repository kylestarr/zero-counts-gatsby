Nintendo reports that they have shipped 52.48 million Switch units since launch. It's estimated that [Microsoft has sold 46.9 million Xbox One units](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/08/why-microsoft-xbox-isnt-as-popular-in-japan-as-sonys-playstation.html) since launch. 5.58 million more units in nearly half the time.
