I’ve been searching for the right words all morning. “Inevitable” certainly is one, but I think “overjoyed” feels better.

[Ever since rumors began circulating about the release of these games on Switch](https://www.zerocounts.net/vgc-nintendo-will-reveal-plans-to-re-release-most-of-super-marios-35-year-back-catalogue-this-year/), the hype has felt insurmountable. We’ve been stuck at home for six months due to a pandemic, [clamoring for comfort content](https://www.zerocounts.net/the-comfort-of-childhood-media-during-lockdown/). A dose of nostalgia this heavy is certainly what the doctor ordered. (A **clinically proven** vaccine wouldn’t be bad either.)

While omitting _Super Mario Galaxy 2_ and making this collection limited until March 31st 2021 is a real bummer, it’s a thrill that this will be released in two weeks time. Tick Tock Clock is counting down.
