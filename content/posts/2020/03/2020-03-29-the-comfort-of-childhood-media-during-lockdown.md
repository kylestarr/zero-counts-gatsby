[Amanda Hess, writing for The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/arts/coronavirus-myst-nostalgia.html):







<blockquote>Myst Time is the opposite of News Time, Twitter Time and Doom Googling Coronavirus Projections Time. The immersive beauty of Myst feels particularly suited to a quarantine: At a time when I can’t go anywhere, it makes me feel far away, surrounded by lapping waves and opulent rugs and actual mist.
> 
> But sheltering in place has also activated a strong nostalgic urge. In this, I don’t think I’m alone. Last week, my colleague Astead Herndon imagined being quarantined with [old Windows computer games](https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley/status/1240038704036687877) like Minesweeper and 3D Pinball Space Cadet; I recently caught my husband playing a reconstruction of The Oregon Trail on a browser. (“You died of dysentery,” he told me.)
> 
> When I saw Herndon’s tweet, I immediately searched for iPhone versions of early ’90s point-and-click adventure games like Sam & Max, Day of the Tentacle, The 7th Guest and Myst — and commenced my reversion. The demand for isolation has knocked me out of my adult life and sent me into a state weirdly reminiscent of childhood, which is the last time I was confined to my bedroom, my free will constrained by a higher authority. I used to play Myst hunched over my family’s hulking PC, home-office doors closed to the rest of my family, and now I play it with my phone in my face, mind blinkered to the rest of the world.

Hess is definitely not alone in this. I am now re-examining my media choices since quarantine began.







When quarantine was imminent, I fought the urge to find a functioning CRT television and Nintendo 64 before lockdown. Since, I've been reading Jeff Tweedy's memoir which reads like a long lost journal of my own childhood, at least before Tweedy's and my musical careers deviated — he has one, I don't. We've been spinning a lot of '80s records in the house. (As I write these words, we are listening to Apple Music's "[80s Soft Rock Essentials](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/80s-soft-rock-essentials/pl.25c27415dc3e46ed800b254cd653cb67)" playlist.) We watched Back to the Future last night. And like every other Switch owner, my wife and I are escaping to Starrbucks, our _Animal Crossing_ island — serenaded by sloshing waves and an acoustic guitar loop that somehow never overstays its welcome. (Friend code SW-2603-2234-0921. Come visit. Bring oranges.)







I have extremely fond memories of _Myst_ — experiencing it with both step-father at home and my father 350 miles away. (I touched on this in my review of [The Witness](https://www.zerocounts.net/the-witness-a-cheaters-review/) and a post about [a rumored _Myst_ television series](https://www.zerocounts.net/myst-tv-drama-and-companion-video-game/).) I've jumped into it once or twice on iOS. It is nice to tap into those old memories. And the mystique of _Myst_ (no pun intended) is one that I'm always chasing. (Queue yearning for _LOST_, _BioShock_, _Annihilation_, _The Room_ iOS games, etc.)







What I could really go for is an iOS port of the 1992 remake of Sierra's [_Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory:_So_You_Want_to_Be_a_Hero) and a macOS port of Sierra's [_Johnny Castaway_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Castaway) screensaver.
