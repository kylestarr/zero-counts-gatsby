[Scott Allen reporting for The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/20/nbcsw-will-broadcast-video-game-simulations-wizards-capitals-games/):



<blockquote>The NBA and NHL seasons, which were suspended last week due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, will resume — in video game form — in the coming days. Monumental Sports Network and NBC Sports Washington on Friday announced that they will broadcast hour-long simulations of the Wizards’ and Capitals’ previously scheduled regular season games using NBA 2K20 and NHL 20, respectively.

I don’t see this as something that will be successful. Just a bit of fun during a growing and tumultuous problem for sports franchises, players, and employees, as well as broadcasters, advertisers, and bookies.

What may have been a success would have been a virtual March Madness tournament.

On March 12, as soon as the [NCAA canceled March Madness due to COVID-19](https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2020/3/10/21173735/coronavirus-march-madness-covid-19-ncaa-tournament-2020-regionals-fans-games), I became eager to tweet that exact idea. Upon researching, to my surprise, there hasn’t been an EA Sports NCAA Basketball game since 2010. Tweet canceled.

An “I called it” would have been in order had I blogged or tweeted this idea. My wife is my only alibi. Alas, I’ve been neglecting Zero Counts. Lesson learned.
