[Jason Schreier reporting for Kotaku:](https://kotaku.com/gamestop-we-can-stay-open-during-lockdowns-because-wer-1842415962)



<blockquote>The struggling video game retail chain GameStop told all of its stores this afternoon to stay open even in the event of state or city lockdowns to protect against the covid-19 pandemic, emphasizing that it is “essential retail” alongside groceries and pharmacies and should therefore be exempt from enforced closures.

“Due to the products we carry that enable and enhance our customers’ experience in working from home, we believe GameStop is classified as essential retail and therefore is able to remain open during this time,” the retailer said in a memo to staff this afternoon, obtained by Kotaku.

“We have received reports of local authorities visiting stores in an attempt to enforce closure despite our classification. Store Managers are approved to provide the document linked below to law enforcement as needed.”

…

Meanwhile, GameStop employees all across the United States have [feared for their safety](https://kotaku.com/gamestops-employees-fear-its-coronavirus-policies-are-d-1842367297) in the wake of the company’s misguided responses to the covid-19 crisis. “Been with company almost a decade,” one told Kotaku this afternoon. “This is indefensible.”

</blockquote>



[Said document](https://www.gamestop.com/preventive-measures.html) is revolting:



<blockquote>While GameStop is best known as a provider of gaming and home entertainment systems, we also offer a wide array of products and devices that are important to facilitate remote work, distance learning, and virtual connectivity. As millions of Americans face unprecedented challenges adapting to virtual learning, working and interaction, there is significant need for technology solutions and we are one of many providers of these products that are remaining open at this time. Schools, businesses and families are now suddenly dependent on being able to connect through technology. While there are many businesses and organizations far more critical than ours, we believe we can have a positive impact during this very challenging time. The health and safety of our employees and customers is of utmost importance and we have and will continue to take extensive precautions consistent with CDC guidelines. We are complying with all state, county, city and local ordinances and we will continue to adjust to any future developments.

</blockquote>



What’s perhaps the most despicable part of this is the “technology” angle. I’d wager a bet having your computer or smartphone repaired ASAP is a bit more critical in a time where we are “suddenly dependent on being able to connect through technology,” yet the largest retailers/repair centers in the world have shut their doors in the name of public safety.

GameStop is a garbage company.

UPDATE: [Later on March 20th, Kotaku reported that GameStop began closing stores in California](https://kotaku.com/gamestop-shuts-down-stores-in-california-1842428841). A single state.

[On March 21st, GameStop decided to close all of its stores](https://kotaku.com/gamestop-finally-closes-stores-to-customers-1842440935), offering curbside pickup at select locations.

Their reluctance is flat out gross.
