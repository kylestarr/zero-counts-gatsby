[Chris Plante, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/28/21405697/nba-players-strike-video-games-union):

> As members of the video game industry consider the power of solidarity, as video game streamers question the sustainability of their labor and the parasocial demands of their audience, as the industry-at-large considers its responsibility to the greater culture, I believe sports could and should serve as a compass.

I’m no sports nut, but this piece cracked me. And it’s made more poignant after watching the sunshine and rainbows Netflix video game docuseries ‘High Score’. Great observations by Plante.
