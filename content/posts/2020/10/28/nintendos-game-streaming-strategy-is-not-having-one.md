[Brendon Bigley, blogging for Into the Aether](https://medium.com/from-the-aether/nintendos-game-streaming-strategy-is-to-not-have-one-5cdbdd7d3e66):

> The thing I find most fascinating about game streaming to the Switch is how antithetical it feels to the way Nintendo markets the device itself. The Nintendo Switch is a home console you can take on the go! Games can be played on your TV or on the train! But not always? The more publishers decide to use companies like Ubitus to provide game streaming instead of building real ports, the more the eShop begins to flood with great looking games that can only be played at home. Yes, you can still swap between TV and handheld, but the actual freedom of the device’s portability fades away when a persistent internet connection is required.

Bigley's take is so good I'm pissed I didn't think of it myself.

I can't imagine Nintendo including cellular connectivity in the rumored Switch Pro, so a streaming strategy for the Switch most certainly breaks the "[designed to fit your life](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/)" paradigm if players are forced to have a Wi-Fi connection to play certain games. That said, streaming is another novel mode for the Switch's portfolio — a handheld; a [home console](/2018/05/23/switch-2nd-unit-set); a blank slate.
