![Electronic Gaming Monthly article titled on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System titled "Still Super After All These Years](/still-super.png)

I came across this article reflecting on 10 years of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in September 2001 issue of EGM (Electronic Gaming Monthly). I was initially humored by the title — Still Super After All These Years. "All These Years" being ten. Surely, ten years is not that long in video game parlance. It's not a far cry from the spread of proper Zelda or Mario games (5-11+ years).

But then I got to thinking... what happened between the release of the SNES and ten years later? Here's a timeline:

- SNES (1990/1991)
- Atari Jaguar (1993)
- Sega CD/Saturn (1994)
- Sony PlayStation 1 (1994)
- Nintendo 64 (1996)
- Sega Dreamcast (1998)
- Sony PlayStation 2 (2000)
- Microsoft Xbox (2001)

Compare that with the last ten:

- Nintendo Switch (2017)
- Microsoft Xbox Series (2020)
- Sony PlayStation 5 (2020)
- Nintendo Switch 2 (2025)

I wouldn't rush to call this the greatest decade in gaming (though, it very may well be). But I'd argue it was the most magical time in video game history. A breakneck pace of console releases. We were witnessing gargantuan leaps in fidelity, design, and input every year or so — from the perfection of 2D side-scrolling and top-down adventures to the birth of 3D and its evolution into arguably what we know it by today.

While it definitely _feels_ like consoles now have diminishing returns —hence Microsoft and Sony’s pivot into subscription services, publishing, and porting — I don't think anything has _illustrated_ it more than the '91–'01 decade.
