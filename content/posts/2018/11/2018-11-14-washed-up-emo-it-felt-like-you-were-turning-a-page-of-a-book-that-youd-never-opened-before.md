[Tom Mullen, host of the Washed Up Emo podcast, interviewing Justin Courtney Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack fame](http://www.washedupemo.com/news/2018/12/ep-141-justin-courtney-pierre-motion-city-soundtrack):


<blockquote>**JCP**: Now we’re all on Twitter and Instagram. We can see at least a version of ourselves that we want to put out to the world, which is still more than when you had to find that one article of the band where they had a few paragraphs. You had to read it. You didn’t get to see video of the person that’s speaking.

It’s just so much easier to connect to people now. There less mystery involved. I think back then, everyone just seemed way cooler than they probably were.

**TM**: This is brought up a bunch because of the time period of some of these bands and their age. You knew it before [the internet/connectivity], and now you have it. You have this context of being able to know when you didn’t have it and that feeling, versus someone today who’s younger doesn’t. They’ve only always had a phone. They’ve always had Wikipedia.

You talked about that feeling, but it’s also that sense of discovery. It felt like you were turning a page of a book that you’d never opened before. That feeling I try and replicate as much as I can today.</blockquote>


More and more I realize how detached I am from new music. As much as I looked forward to the new [Cursive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/vitriola/1423375538), [Minus the Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fair-enough-ep/1407932484), [Saves the Day](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/9/1423225819), and [Thrice](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/palms/1402812295) records, they are new records from old bands. Plus, there was little for me to chew on aside from the music itself. Little in the way of liner-notes, thank yous, etc. Or maybe it’s just my lack of focus, time, and energy.

Even more is that my pendulum of consumption has swung far in the opposite direction of video games to books this year. I don’t think I’ve finished a single game I’ve purchased in 2018.

Together, I now get the sense of discovery I used to have with music intertwined with the insatiable appetite I had for video games rolled into reading. I’m on pace to read more than I ever have in a single year.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, [books are my new albums](https://www.zerocounts.net/general/books-are-my-new-albums/).
