[Polygon's Michael McWhertor on the Quality Control podcast with host Dave Tach](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/11/17562474/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch-3ds-podcast-review-quality-control):


<blockquote>For a few years now, I have promoted and evangelized _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_. To the point where I think even people at Nintendo are like, "hey, send this guy the _Captain Toad_ review code first."

I love the game. I love the character. It's a great little puzzle game. It was one of those things that was released on the Wii U — which didn't have a ton of great games, but this was a real standout in my opinion — and not a lot of people owned the Wii U. [Captain Toad] was something that was overlooked by a lot of people. It's a fun little package. Now that it's out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS, people have no excuse not to go play _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_.

...

In 2013, Nintendo released _Super Mario 3D World_, and excellent platformer for the Wii U. In that game, there were a handful of levels featuring Captain Toad. You gave up control of Mario, Peach, Luigi, etc., and you played as Captain Toad in these tiny little diorama-style levels where Toad would walk around with a headlamp and a heavy backpack.

He couldn't run and jump. He could basically just walk around levels. He could fall down things. There were switches you could pull to raise him up on platforms. But each one was just this cute, clever little puzzle level that felt like Nintendo experimenting within the Mario Universe.

Mike and I share similar feelings about _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_. The game itself is a charming, clever, puzzle game. But beyond that, it's a wonderful expansion on a more realized Mushroom Kingdom. And it was great to see the character return in _Super Mario Odyssey_.

I've said it once and I'll say it again, [_Captain Toad_](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/11/captain-toad-is-genius/)[ is genius](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/11/captain-toad-is-genius/).
