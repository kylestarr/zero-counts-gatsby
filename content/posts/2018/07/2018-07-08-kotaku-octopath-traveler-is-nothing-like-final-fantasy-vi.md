[Jason Schreier](https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-is-nothing-like-final-fantasy-vi-1827391950):


<blockquote>The producer of the gorgeous upcoming Switch game _Octopath Traveler_ made waves this week with a quote in which he said that mechanically it was a spiritual successor to _Final Fantasy VI_. Other people have made similar comparisons. But _Octopath_ is nothing like _Final Fantasy VI_—it’s more like a _SaGa_ game, with some experimental ideas that work, and some that really don’t.

</blockquote>

I’ve played a little over an hour of the _Octopath Traveler_ demo and am chipping away at some initial thoughts. One of those thoughts — contrary to both Takahashi-san and Schreier — is that _Octopath Traveler_ feels like _Final Fantasy X_.

Each character has an individual relationship, conflict, and narrative, the visual turn-based system is akin to that of FFX, and there is an odd mismatch between the writing style and voice acting; the writing feels high-brow English juxtaposed to the modern American voice acting. While it’s certainly not the same problem, it is reminiscent of [_FFX_](https://youtu.be/WJotVinhXJ4)[’s infamous laughing scene](https://youtu.be/WJotVinhXJ4).
