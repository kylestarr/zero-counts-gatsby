[Wonderland](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533949/wonderland-by-steven-johnson/) by Steven Johnson


<blockquote>Art is the aftershock of technological plates shifting. Sometimes the aftershock is slow in arriving. It took the novel about three hundred years to evolve into its modern form after the invention of the printing press. The television equivalent of the novel—the complex serialized drama of _The Wire_ or _Breaking Bad_—took as long as seventy years to develop, depending on where you date its origins.

I've often thought about today's serialized, bingeable, [Golden Age of Television](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_(2000s–present)) as the visual equivalent of the novel. Rich worlds. Deep investment in characters. Time to marinate with relationships and stakes.

Before the Golden Age of Television, I was captivated by trilogies — hell, I still am — namely Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_ (Extended Editions!) I hadn't read the books, but I felt an attachment to the characters. Its cohesive production, year-over-year release schedule, and follow-through of Tolkien's parallel stories and stakes built a world I was able to immerse myself in.

Peter Jackson's _[Lord of the Rings runs 9 hours in total](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)#Home_media)_, the extended editions running 11 hours — not dissimilar from a Golden Age television series.
