[Play Anything](http://bogost.com/books/play-anything/) by Ian Bogost


<blockquote>What does it mean for something to be _fun_? If you wanted to design a fun toaster, or lead a fun classroom, or advertise a fun job, or write a fun book, how would you go about it? If you wanted to find a fun appliance to buy, or a fun course to take, or a fun career to pursue, or a fun book to read, what heuristic would you choose to select one? Most of us have no idea. We don't even know what fun is, even though we claim to want it in everything. We've misunderstood _fun_ to mean enjoyment without effort. Nothing has been spared the cursed attempt to "make it fun"; everything whatsoever hopes to transform itself into a delightful little morsel of sugar in your mouth.</blockquote>
