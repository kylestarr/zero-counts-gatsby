[Ben Thompson, Stratechery Daily Update](https://stratechery.com/2018/xbox-all-access-pass-the-eighth-generation-of-consoles-console-subscriptions-now-and-the-future/?utm_source=Memberful&utm_campaign=9efd803e67-daily_update_2018_09_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-9efd803e67-110885749):


<blockquote>That noted, it is not too difficult to imagine this program morphing into something much more significant in the ninth-generation, which is [due in 2020](https://www.businessinsider.com/next-xbox-scarlett-details-2018-7?utm_source=Memberful&utm_campaign=9efd803e67-daily_update_2018_09_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-9efd803e67-110885749). Iâ€™ve already discussed the [anticipated shift to streaming](https://stratechery.com/2018/scooter-follow-up-microsoft-and-the-xbox-spotify-signs-indie-acts/?utm_source=Memberful&utm_campaign=9efd803e67-daily_update_2018_09_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-9efd803e67-110885749), at least for some titles; that, naturally, fits a subscription model perfectly.

What is particularly compelling, though, is idea of assuming regular hardware upgrades throughout the generation. Microsoft could, of course, simply charge its best gamers for those slight upgrades every time they come out, but what if instead of financing new consoles the model was more akin to leasing? Pay one monthly fee, get access to online services, streaming games, and new hardware every few years?

Consumer hardware as a service.
