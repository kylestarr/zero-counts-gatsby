[Play Anything](http://bogost.com/books/play-anything/) by Ian Bogost


<blockquote>The lesson that games can teach us is simple. Games aren't appealing because they are fun, but because they are _limited_. Because they erect boundaries. Because we must accept their structures in order to play them. Soccer sees two teams of eleven players attempting to use their feet, torsos, and heads to put a ball into a goal. Tetris asks you to position falling arrangements of four orthogonally-connected squares in order to produce and remove horizontal lines. And yet the experiences games like soccer and Tetris create are far larger than those boundaries convey on their own. That bounty results from the deliberate, if absurd, pursuit of soccer and Tetris on their own terms, within the limitations they erect. The _limitations_ make games fun.</blockquote>
