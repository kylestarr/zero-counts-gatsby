[Play Anything](http://bogost.com/books/play-anything/) by Ian Bogost


<blockquote>My daughter's mall game illustrates these principles. She saw and acknowledged the tiles, which are separately laid and grouted for the ease of manufacture, transport, installation, and maintenance. But rather than allowing that material distinction to recede into the background, to become mere substrate for our far more urgent pursuit of retail commerce, she made the tile / grout pairing the focus of her attention. She added to them the speed of her gait as pulled along by me, my hand and body as it attached to and pulled her to and fro erratically, the shape and size of her feet, the traction or slipperiness of her shoes, the vectors along which runs counter to our ordinary conception of play as a release of tension and responsibility.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Then, even though I was merely an accessory to her game rather than a party to it, she forced me to recognize and acknowledge the space she'd created. The tiles, the grout, her shoes, and so on—I became newly aware of these things simply by virtue of attending to her indirectly. We must seek to capture that magic everywhere; in everything. Not the pleasure of realizing our own goals—as if we even know that they are or ought to be—but the gratification of meeting the world more than halfway, almost _all_ the way, and reaping the spoils of our new discoveries made under the sail of generosity rather than selfishness.</blockquote>
