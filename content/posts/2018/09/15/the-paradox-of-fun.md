[Play Anything](http://bogost.com/books/play-anything/) by Ian Bogost


<blockquote>The paradox of fun is this: we think fun is enjoyment, but in practice it often feels like quite the opposite. On the one hand, we'd never think to describe uncomfortable or distressing experience as fun ones, but on the other hand, discomfort or distress often characterize the experiences we later describe as fun. A fun match of soccer might involve physical and emotional injury; a fun trip to the zoo might entail heat exhaustion and stained overalls. And yet fun doesn't _feel_ like suffering either, exactly, even when it literally involves suffering. Otherwise we'd not call it fun, but hardship.</blockquote>
