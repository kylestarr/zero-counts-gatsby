[Brave New World](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062696120/brave-new-world/) by Aldous Huxley:


<blockquote>"But why is it prohibited?" Asked the Savage. In the excitement of meeting a man who had read Shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else.

The Controller shrugged his shoulders. "Because it's old; that's the chief reason. We haven't any use for old things here."

"Even when they're beautiful?"

"Particularly when they're beautiful. Beauty's attractive, and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones."</blockquote>
