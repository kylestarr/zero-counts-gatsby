<blockquote>You know that feeling you get when you learn something that blows your mind, something new, something that perhaps you didn’t even think to ask about? That’s our goal with every Vox video: We want to help you understand the world in a visually clear, creative, and hopefully beautiful way.

If that sounds like a mission you support, and you love our videos, then we ask that you consider joining the [Vox Video Lab](http://vox.com/join?_ga=2.108740226.183567848.1545104322-1536174881.1509387189), our brand-new membership program on YouTube that will help us give you even more ambitious explainer videos and series.

Why are we doing this? The core reason is pretty simple: Our videos take a _ton_ of work.

Well, how about that. The day after [divulging my affinity for Vox Media's creators](https://www.zerocounts.net/media/whats-in-a-creator/), they establish their first membership program.

Thrilled to be a Video Lab Advisory Board member.
