[Letter from a Region in My Mind](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind) by James Baldwin for _The New Yorker_, 1962:



<blockquote>If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time we got rid of Him.</blockquote>
