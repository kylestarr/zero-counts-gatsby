Moments ago, WSJ broke news that [WSJ breaking Nintendo news](https://www.zerocounts.net/business/wsj-is-breaking-nintendo/).

Earlier this evening, after seeing reviews for _Super Mario Party_ emerge, it dawned on me the appropriateness of the "super" brand in an era of mid-cycle console refreshes. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was a next-gen console at the time, but "Super" now feels like a supreme version of an existing console.

My crack-pot hunch is that this new Switch will be named the "Super Switch" (as opposed to "Switch XL") and will feature a larger display (smaller bezel), richer speakers, better kickstand placement, and Bluetooth headphone support at a minimum. Just a hunch.
