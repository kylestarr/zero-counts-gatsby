[Ben Kuchera, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/29/18038242/why-you-should-buy-an-xbox-one-x):


<blockquote>The ability to play classic games in 4K is one of the most interesting, and sometimes under-discussed, features of the Xbox One X. The system currently provides the only way [to play the first _Red Dead Redemption _in 4K](https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/11/17224660/red-dead-redemption-xbox-one-x-4k-backwards-compatibility), and doing so is absolutely worth your time. [The list of Xbox One X-enhanced games](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility) that are backward-compatible isn’t huge — there are currently only 21 as of this writing — but there are some jewels in there, from the original _Mirror’s Edge_ to _Portal_.</blockquote>


I bought a 4K HDR TV last weekend. My first thought after purchasing it was, "PS4 Pro or Xbox One X?"

Thankfully for my wallet, the original PS4 supports HDR, and that's more meaningful than 4K in my book. But had I owned neither, I'd be all over the Xbox One X.

While the breadth of catalog isn't there, there's certainly enough for my casual needs. But most importantly, for cross-platform games, I'd know I'm getting the best console experience on the market. That's tough to swallow for a snob like me.

Between (enhanced) backwards-compatibility, early adoption of cross-platform multiplayer, and unmatched performance, I agree with Kuchera. This will be a holiday to watch Microsoft.
