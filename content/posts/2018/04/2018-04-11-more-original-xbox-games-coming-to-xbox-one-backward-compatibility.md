Later this month, we’ll release two batches of Original Xbox games – the first on April 17 and the second on April 26. All of these Original Xbox games will take advantage of the power of Xbox One with up to 4X the pixel count on Xbox One and Xbox One S, and up to 16X the pixel count on Xbox One X. See below for the full list of titles that will be available later this month, and don’t forget to visit [https://majornelson.com/blog/xbox-one-backward-compatibility/](https://majornelson.com/blog/xbox-one-backward-compatibility/) for the full list of backward compatible titles available on Xbox One.

This is an impressive list of titles.

Microsoft's continued focus on backward compatibility is a smart move. It certainly won't be enough to sell the tens of millions of units necessary to catch up to PlayStation 4's sales figures, but in conjunction with increasing cross-network compatibility and the impressive power in the Xbox One X (vs. the PS4 Pro), I think Microsoft has turned a story-telling corner.

That said, for the same reasons I think backwards compatibility is a winning strategy for Xbox One, I think the Nintendo Switch will hold the lead on the conversation for a long while. After only 1 year on store shelves, the Switch's sales trajectory (14 million units) will likely surpass Xbox One's total 25-30 million units in 2018. PlayStation 4 has a much greater lead at 76.5 million units sold over 4.5 years. However, 14 million units in one year is without Nintendo breaking the seal on their back-catalog. And unless Microsoft or Sony glom on to exclusive licenses for third-party back-catalog — they won't — there's no telling who else may hop aboard the Switch train. (Come on, _Final Fantasy X_ and _Kingdom Hearts_!)
