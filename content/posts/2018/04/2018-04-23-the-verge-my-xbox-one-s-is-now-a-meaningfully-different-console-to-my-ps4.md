[Sam Byford, The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17251030/xbox-one-backwards-compatibility-360-panzer-dragoon-orta):


<blockquote>It’s also something that Sony simply isn’t able to offer, given the complexity of the PlayStation 3 hardware and consequent difficulty of emulating its software. And to be clear, Sony doesn’t really need to do it — the PS4 library is more than strong enough to make the console worth buying. If I only owned an Xbox and had the choice of being able to play the likes of _Nier Automata_, _Uncharted_, and _Horizon Zero Dawn_ instead of a bunch of games from the last decade, I’d take it. It’s the paucity of Xbox One-exclusive content that is forcing Microsoft to find other ways to get people to use the platform.

That’s actually fine with me. I like that my Xbox One S is now a meaningfully different console to my PS4 Pro, with different use cases and functionality. It’s the box I go to for 4K Blu-rays, _Forza Horizon 3_ in HDR, or _Ninja Gaiden Black_ with a usable controller. It’s the box I switch on to browse through when I’m not sure what I feel like doing, or when I’d rather play Cuphead on the couch than at my desk.

[As I said](https://www.zerocounts.net/2018/04/10/more-original-xbox-games-coming-to-xbox-one-backward-compatibility/), I think Microsoft has turned a story-telling corner.
