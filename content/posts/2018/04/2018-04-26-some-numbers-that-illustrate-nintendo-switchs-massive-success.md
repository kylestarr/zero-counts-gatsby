[Jason Schreier reporting for Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/some-numbers-that-illustrate-nintendo-switchs-massive-s-1825561698):


<blockquote>Nintendo today reported its earnings for the [2017 fiscal year](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/), which means a whole bunch of interesting new sales numbers to look at. They’re all impressive, and they all show the massive appeal of Nintendo Switch.

Here are a few numbers that, taken together, make for some good perspective on just how successful Nintendo’s latest console has been throughout its first year on the market.</blockquote>


Wild numbers to the Switch's set-top predecessor, the Wii U.

The Switch is more or less tracking the same sales pace as PS4. It took a little over one year for the [PS4 to reach 18.5 worldwide hardware sell-through units](http://www.sie.com/en/corporate/release/2015/150106.html) — November 22, 2013 - January 4, 2015.

Microsoft has been mum on sales figures, but in 2016 [slipped that the Xbox One had sold “around 18 to 19 million” units](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/ea-lets-slip-lifetime-xbox-one-and-ps4-consoles-sales/), two years after launch.
