[Chris Plante, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17226486/god-of-war-review-ps4-2018):


<blockquote>All of which is to say that the game is relaxed to the point of bordering on indifferent. Many of _God of War_’s most interesting surprises are optional, branching from the game’s sturdy throughline: secret rooms giving way to hidden caverns winding to towering statues or belligerent dragons — which I would have missed altogether had I just followed my compass to the next objective. You don’t find collectibles; you find entire chunks of story tucked behind a mossy wall or under a tropical island. _God of War_, like last year’s [_Nier: Automata_](https://www.polygon.com/game/nier-automata/38754) and [_The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_](https://www.polygon.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/8645)_,_ rewards the player who inspects its immaculately designed world as if it were a hidden object game.</blockquote>


This reminds me of _Star Fox 64_. A player could "beat" _Star Fox 64_ without ever visiting over 50% of the areas/missions created for the game. ("Beat" in quotes as the path the player uncovers indicates a level of completeness, ultimately leading to a truer ending.)

It's one thing to sprinkle trinkets throughout a game. It's another to build entire stories and environments that may never be found. _God of War_ sounds remarkable.
