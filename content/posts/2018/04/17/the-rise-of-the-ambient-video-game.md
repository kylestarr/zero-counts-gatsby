[Lewis Gordon, writing for The Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/4181/ambient-video-game-legend-of-zelda):

> Both _The Legend of Zelda_ and these ambient records channeled the natural elements of water, earth, and air — phenomena of increasing rarity in the modern Japanese city. To step into such video game worlds was to stabilise oneself within the frenetic noise and anonymity of the expanding urban spaces. The Famicom allowed players to experience video games from the comfort of their home while Yoshimura, alongside other ambient artists of the era such as [Satoshi Ashikawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaWdVJO5H98), designed their records for public spaces whose mood they attempted to subtly augment. Later, in 1993, Haruomi Hosono, member of Yellow Magic Orchestra, released [_Medicine Compilation From the Quiet Lodge_](https://open.spotify.com/album/3qaEUrwOgFVPIfaIMuJVcS), an ambient album touching on house and techno but infused with Japan’s past and elementalism. Its title articulated the healing potential of music created outside of the metropolis.

A lovely observation and read by Gordon.
