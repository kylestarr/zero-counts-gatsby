[Patrick Klepek for Vice’s Waypoint](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/a3ya54/most-video-games-are-too-long):


<blockquote>_Minit_ knew what it wanted to accomplish, and how long it took to accomplish it. Done. But it also left me wanting more. If they announce a sequel—may I propose Another Minit?—I’ll be there with bells on. Too many games leave me exhausted, as if my dozens of hours have only made a small dent. (This is especially true for open world games.)

</blockquote>

I recently played and completed _Florence_ on iOS in 40 minutes. In that short stint, it hooked me, filled me with hope, sadness, and nostalgia, and ultimately left a last impression on me. It felt much like [Disney’s ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/paperman/id601669104)[_Paperman_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/paperman/id601669104)[ short](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/paperman/id601669104).

I understand the feeling of immersion, but even with _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ — as focused on in the previous post — I was yearning to finish. Most of the most impactful gaming experiences I’ve had have been shy of four hours; _Journey_ — again, mentioned in [Lewis Gordon's 'The Rise of the Ambient Video Game'](https://theoutline.com/post/4181/ambient-video-game-legend-of-zelda) previously linked to — has been the most impactful of all. Another being _Dear Esther_.

Speaking got both _Journey_ and _Dear Esther_, see also [‘Why the Two-hour Game is the Future’](https://www.zerocounts.net/2014/10/14/why-the-two-hour-game-is-the-future/).
