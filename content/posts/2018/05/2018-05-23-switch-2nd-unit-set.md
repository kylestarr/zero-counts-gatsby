[Sam Byford, The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17383104/nintendo-switch-dockless-bundle-japan-price):


<blockquote>Nintendo is now [selling](https://topics.nintendo.co.jp/c/article/3063da9b-5c8b-11e8-b311-063b7ac45a6d.html) a cheaper Switch package in Japan that doesn't include the TV dock. The “Switch 2nd Unit Set” is ostensibly aimed at households that already have a Switch hooked up to the family TV and therefore don't need a second dock, but it could also be an option for players who only plan to use the system as a handheld device.
