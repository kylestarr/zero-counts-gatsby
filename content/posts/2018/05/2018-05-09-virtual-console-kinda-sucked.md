[Chris Kohler, Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773):


<blockquote>Virtual Console is [no more](https://kotaku.com/virtual-console-is-not-coming-to-switch-nintendo-says-1825848253), but that doesn’t mean that Switch won’t become the best place to play classic games. It’ll just be done in a different way than what Nintendo’s tried in the past. And that’s a good thing, because Virtual Console kinda sucked.

Now, by “Virtual Console kinda sucked” I do not mean “Nintendo’s old games are bad,” or even that Virtual Console’s game selection was bad, or anything like that. In case you are wholly unfamiliar with my work, I love old games and think that as many of them as possible should be kept in print on modern-day hardware. I just think that Virtual Console, the feature, was an inefficient way of implementing this idea, and that there is a better way. Virtual Console died so that retro gaming on Switch could live.

My knee-jerk response to [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/) was disappointment. 20 8-bit games, while great, seemed paltry.

However, [heeding my own words](https://www.zerocounts.net/2018/04/10/more-original-xbox-games-coming-to-xbox-one-backward-compatibility/), Nintendo doesn’t need to release any more than this for the new service. The games are the lure. The online play and cloud saves are the lock-in. Nintendo will trickle classic titles out over time when needed. Additions of consoles (SNES, N64,... GameCube) will be tentpole announcements — when needed.

That said, I agree with Kohler. And Adult Swim Games’ [Chris Johnson](https://twitter.com/superpac/status/993806026259525632?s=21). Truth is, as much as I loved playing NES, SNES, and N64 games on my Wii and Wii U, I hated not knowing what releases to expect and when to expect them. Likewise, as Kohler mentions in his piece, the pricing structure seemed bananas. Virtual Console kinda sucked.

I do wish Nintendo was offering up more than NES titles, but I get why they aren’t. I’ll take this handful for now with the excitement that lots more classics will arrive at the low fee of $20 per year.
