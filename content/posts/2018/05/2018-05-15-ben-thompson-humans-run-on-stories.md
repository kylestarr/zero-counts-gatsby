[Ben Thompson on ](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/05/08/ep-221)[_The Talk Show with John Gruber_](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/05/08/ep-221)[ podcast](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/05/08/ep-221):


<blockquote>Stories matter. Humans run on stories.

I look at [my own site](https://stratechery.com) and the articles that often resonate are not the ones with brilliant analysis or something clever. It’s the ones that tell a story.

People know it implicitly, but have a very difficult time articulating it. If you’re selling to consumers, there’s so much that goes into it that doesn’t go on a spreadsheet. That sort of stuff matters.

</blockquote>

I subscribe to Ben’s [_Stratechery_](https://stratechery.com/membership/)[ Daily Update newsletter](https://stratechery.com/membership/). I read a lot of it and consider Ben’s insights priceless. But it’s typically his free weekly articles that grab me.

His most recent, ‘[Tech’s Two Philosophies](https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/)’, had me reeling. After reading it over morning coffee, I raced to work to share it with my team.

I shoehorned Ben’s ideas into something relevant to our work. It was a stretch, but I don’t think overly so. Regardless, I was so moved by the story in the piece that it woke me up better than any cup of coffee.

Humans run on stories. They absolutely do.
