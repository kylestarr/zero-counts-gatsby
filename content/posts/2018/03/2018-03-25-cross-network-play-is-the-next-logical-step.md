[Matthew Handrahan, GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-03-21-epic-games-the-barrier-between-xbox-and-playstation-will-inevitably-come-down):


<blockquote>Epic believes that the same process is starting to happen in markets like the US and Europe, thanks in no small part to refinements and improvements made to the Unreal Engine. During State of Unreal, Studio Wildcard's co-founders Doug Kennedy and Jesse Rapczak came onstage to talk about Ark: Survival Evolved on mobile, and announced that it was [being ported for Nintendo Switch](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-03-21-how-they-got-ark-survival-evolved-working-on-switch). Sweeney also mentioned the mobile version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, which was [first announced](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-11-27-pubg-going-mobile-with-tencents-help) in November last year.

Another example is, of course, Epic's own Fortnite, which Sweeney believes is "unique" even within the context of the larger trend; principally because the work Epic has done to make it possible will benefit anyone that uses the Unreal Engine.

"So that they can do the same thing," Sweeney adds. "And that is build one unified game that runs on all platforms, that is the same experience everywhere, and is a social experience that you can play with friends across all of the different platforms.

"What we have is this one engine that's supporting AAA production values and game sizes and content bases that runs everywhere. This is going to be a great setup for the games industry, because it means that now you don't have a divide between casual mobile games and high-end PC and console games."

For Epic, this all makes complete sense and will give Unreal Engine a massive leg up as a development tool.

I wrote about the need for cross-network play in my piece [Sold on Cross-Network Play](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/06/18/sold-on-cross-network-play/). Much of the piece — albeit not transparently — stemmed from my frustration of having to hook up my Xbox One to play _Overwatch_ with my friends. It was extremely encouraging to learn that players of _Minecraft_ and _Rocket League _would be able to share experiences between Switch, Xbox One, and Steam.

Sony claims that their reluctance of opening cross-network play is out of [protection of their community](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-13-sony-defends-decision-to-block-cross-play-with-xbox-one-and-nintendo-switch). I think that is a fair stance, but is the Sony community any less toxic than others? I think the real fear is losing an amount of ability to lock in players to PlayStation 4. It's the same case made for exclusive games and content, the latter I vehemently oppose.

Maybe it's just the era I grew up in, but I believe in exclusive first-party experiences. Beyond the console wars which were somewhat steeped in technology battles as much as publishing and political ones, there is something to be said for the marriage of first-party hardware and software. Nintendo and Apple are prime examples this, creating unique and often stellar experiences by leveraging both sides of the stack.

Sony can hold their own when it comes to exclusives. It's time to open the network.
