[Christopher Dring, GamesIndustry.biz](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-01-19-nintendos-share-price-jumps-on-labo-reveal):


<blockquote>Nintendo's share have risen more 4.2% and hit an almost ten-year high following the reveal of its Labo concept.

Nintendo Labo is a toys-to-life style Switch project, which combines the Switch hardware with DIY cardboard models to create new gameplay experience. The concept is targeted at younger gamers, although judging by the online reaction, is going to appeal quite broadly.

[We're not entirely convinced](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-01-18-nintendo-labo-the-next-wonderbook) by its commercial potential (although it does look great), but Nintendo shareholders clearly are. At the time of writing, Nintendo's share price is the highest it has been since 2008 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It currently sits at ¥48,320, which is the highest since September 2008, during the initial comedown of the Wii and DS.</blockquote>
