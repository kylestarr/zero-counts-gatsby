[John Ballard, The Mot](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/22/nintendo-switch-is-the-fastest-selling-console-in.aspx)[le](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/22/nintendo-switch-is-the-fastest-selling-console-in.aspx)[y Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/22/nintendo-switch-is-the-fastest-selling-console-in.aspx):


<blockquote>The best-selling console ever is the PS2, which launched in 2000 and sold 157.68 million units over its life cycle, according to VGChartz. Sony shipped 10.61 million units in the first year of  PS2 sales.

Nintendo's all-time best-selling game console -- Wii -- sold more than 4 million units within the first 10 months, and totaled 101.63 million units over its life cycle.

As for Switch, management says it expects Switch sales to reach 16 million by the end of Nintendo's fiscal year in March 2018. That puts Switch way ahead of PS2, and on pace to be the best-selling console ever.
