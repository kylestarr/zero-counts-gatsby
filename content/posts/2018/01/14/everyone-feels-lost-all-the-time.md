[_Uncharted_ director and writer Amy Hennig and Campo Santo (_Firewatch_) founder Sean Vanaman in conversation](https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/12/16880484/amy-hennig-sean-vanaman-interview-year-in-review) for [Polygon's excellent _2017 Year in Review_ essay series](https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/8/16854306/best-video-games-2017-year-in-review):

> **Amy Hennig:** I talk to students and young developers sometimes, and they’re always sort of amazed to find out that everybody has imposter syndrome.
>
> **Sean Vanaman:** I still feel like I’m ripping everyone off.
>
> **Amy Hennig:** You look back at your own work and go, “I’m not even sure how I did that.”
>
> **Sean Vanaman:** Exactly.
>
> **Amy Hennig:** So even though you have this underlying sense of faith and tell yourself, “Well, I’ve been here lots of times, and I’ve always figured out a way to solve these problems, so I’ve got to relax and assume that I will figure it out again,” in the moment you’re like, “I don’t know how I did that before. I don’t know what I’m doing.” And everybody feels that way. It’s something I haven’t heard creative people talk about that much until recently. I always hear this sigh of relief when I bring it up. Everyone feels lost all the time.

This is a wonderful conversation between polar perspectives. Whether you're running a large ship or a tiny dinghy, self-doubt is inevitable. I'll add that it's not just the captains that encounter it.

The quicker everyone and lay bare their uncertainties, the quicker the entire crew can sail in the same direction.
