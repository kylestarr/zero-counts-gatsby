[Michael McWhertor, Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/17/16902886/nintendo-switch-labo-cardboard-toy-con-price-release-date-trailer):


<blockquote>Labo will let Nintendo Switch owners build cardboard versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod or motorbike. Nintendo calls those cardboard creations Toy-Cons. And, by inserting Joy-Con controllers into those Toy-Cons, players will be able to play games themed to the cardboard creations.

“With each Nintendo Labo kit, kids can transform modular sheets of cardboard – specially designed to interact with the Nintendo Switch console and Joy-Con controllers — into creations called Toy-Con,” Nintendo said. “As you build, you will have fun discovering how the technology works, and might even invent new ways to play with each Toy-Con!"

</blockquote>

No one could have predicted Toy-Con. Try as you might, cardboard attachment kits for the Switch are not just out of left field, they are on a different pitch altogether.

There is an increasing wealth of junior robotics and toy-to-life experiences on the market. This is a clever, unique take on that market — and [does Google Cardboard one better](https://twitter.com/_kylestarr/status/953752861698961408).

When folks call Nintendo a crazy toymaker, they're not joking.
