During today's Nintendo Direct Mini, Nintendo announced [_Dark Souls: Remastered_](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dark-souls-remastered-switch)[ will be heading to the Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dark-souls-remastered-switch) on May 25, 2018. The title will also be launching on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

This continues a trickle of AAA third-party ports to the hybrid portable/set-top console. In 2017, among other third-party ports, Bethesda released _Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim _and _DOOM_ to the console and will soon to be releasing _Wolfenstein 2: New Colossus_.

_Dark Souls_ was originally released in 2011 for PS3 and Xbox 360. It spawned two sequels and riff _Bloodborne_.

I have never played a _Souls_ game. The idea of sitting in front of a TV, beating my head against an insanely difficult boss for hours on end is not a luxury my life can afford. However, doing so on a portable console is a whole different story.

Killing hours traveling, accompanying my wife on the sofa, relaxing in bed, stealing myself away to _any_ place to chip away at a game are the reasons [I've tucked my consoles away](https://www.zerocounts.net/2017/08/05/sell-my-old-consoles-im-off-to-handheld/). Furthermore, the ability to quickly put the Switch to sleep and seamlessly launch back into a title make it my ultimate gaming device. For all of these reasons, I feel the Switch will allow me to join the _Souls_ conversation, finally.

While _Dark Souls: Remastered_ is the first of the series, the announcement of another classic PS3/Xbox 360 port to the Switch extends my enthusiasm for the console. I'm reminded of how tickled I was seeing this tweet by [Jon Cartwright](https://twitter.com/NomComms):

Honestly, it's remarkable to see a Nintendo console glean so much third-party support. I'll just keep my fingers crossed for _Cuphead_.
