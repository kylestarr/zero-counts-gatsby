![The Aether](the-aether.jpeg)

As a fan of [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online), it excited me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway on the [Season 4 kickoff GBA episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/into-the-aether/id1415546090?i=1000526818592), I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I’m hanging out with friends more than listening to a show.

_The Aether_ is my own interpretation of the “the aether” — something light and ethereal with splashes of the signature _Into the Aether_ purple to pink gradient. I’m a big fan of [berndog’s](https://instagram.com/berndoggers), and one of his builds featured a left/right dual-tone which got me thinking…

In total, _The Aether_ includes:
