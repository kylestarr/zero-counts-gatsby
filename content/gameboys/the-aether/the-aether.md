As a fellow fan of Into the Aether, it excites me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway, I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I‚Äôm hanging out with friends more than listening to a show. I‚Äôm sure your feelings are no different.

The Aether is my own interpretation of the ‚Äúthe aether‚Äù ‚Äî¬†something light and ethereal with splashes of the signature ITA purple to pink gradient. I‚Äôm a big fan of berndog‚Äôs, and one of his builds featured a left/right dual-tone which got me thinking‚Ä¶ ü§î In total, The Aether includes:
