![Game Boy Advance, Mint](gba-mint.jpeg)

This might be my favorite GBA color palette yet! Initially, I attempted to use a shell by RetroSix, but was disappointed by the display mounting solution and bad branding. Thankfully, I was able to track down a sold out light blue FunnyPlaying shell — the preferred shell of most modders — which also fits the FunnyPlaying glass nicely.

The logic board in came from an AGB-001 — the first run of GBAs produced in 2001. It was in extremely good condition, save a dirty power switch which prevented it from powering on, and a defective right-shoulder button. I believe this is the first AGB-001 unit I’ve worked on.

With that, here’s a breakdown of the full mod:
