As a fellow fan of Into the Aether, it excites me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway, I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I’m hanging out with friends more than listening to a show. I’m sure your feelings are no different.

The White Whale comes inspired by the ongoing theme of “white whale” games that Brendon and Stephen are chasing. The solid white shell + clear button build is the exact opposite of the companion Whale build which features a clear black shell + solid buttons. In total, The White Whale includes:
