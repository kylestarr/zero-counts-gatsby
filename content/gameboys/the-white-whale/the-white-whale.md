![The White Whale](the-white-whale.jpeg)

As a fan of [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online), it excites me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway, I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I’m hanging out with friends more than listening to a show.

_The White Whale_ comes inspired by the ongoing podcast theme of “white whale” games that hosts Brendon and Stephen are chasing. The solid white shell + clear button build is the exact opposite of the companion [_Whale_](/gameboys/the-whale-scouts-whale) build which features a clear black shell + solid buttons.

In total, _The White Whale_ includes:
