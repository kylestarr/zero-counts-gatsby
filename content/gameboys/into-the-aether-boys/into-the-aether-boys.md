![Into the Aether Boys](into-the-aether-boys.jpeg)

This collection of Game Boy Advances were built as gifts for the hosts and producer of the [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online) podcast. As a long time fan, I wanted to give back to the show with through my new found hobby of Game Boy modding. I packaged these up, shuffled them around, and sent a random unit to each member of the Aether team.

Unfortunately, I don't have build notes from these units.
