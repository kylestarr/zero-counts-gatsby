As a fellow fan of Into the Aether, it excites me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway, I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I’m hanging out with friends more than listening to a show. I’m sure your feelings are no different.

The Whale comes inspired by the whale featured on the cover art of Seasons 3 and 4 by Scout. The clear black shell + solid button build is the exact opposite of the companion White Whale build which features a solid white shell + clear buttons. In total, The Whale includes:

- New IPS LCD w/ brightness controls (select + L/R) by FunnyPlaying
- New speaker by FunnyPlaying
- Shell by FunnyPlaying
- Prestige Buttons by RetroSix
- New glass screen
- New stock capacitors
- Power Cleaner Flex by Helder
- One dehum/dehiss capacitor by RetroSix
- Cleaned power switch
