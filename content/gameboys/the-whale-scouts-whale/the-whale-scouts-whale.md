![The Whale (Scout's Whale)](the-whale-scouts-whale.jpeg)

As a fan of [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online), it excited me to no end to play a small role in the show. When Brendon and Stephen asked me to build three Game Boy Advance units for a giveaway on the [Season 4 kickoff GBA episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/into-the-aether/id1415546090?i=1000526818592), I was over the moon. The podcast has provided me much needed levity during heavy times and feels like I’m hanging out with friends more than listening to a show.

_The Whale_ comes inspired by the whale featured on the cover art of _Into the Aether_ Seasons 3 and 4 by [Scout Wilkinson](https://scoutwilkinson.myportfolio.com). The clear black shell + solid button build is the exact opposite of the companion [_White Whale_](/gameboys/the-white-whale) build which features a solid white shell + clear buttons.

In total, _The Whale_ includes:
